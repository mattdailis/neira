Distance: 1400m Conditions: Race order: 2V, 3V, 1V.
2V race rowed into approximately 12 mph cross headwind. Due to the wind, alignment took a little longer, and pushed the race to about 1420m.
3V saw an increase in winds and a pronounced shift to a truer crosswind in the last 400m.
1V had the balmiest conditions, with a weaker cross head.
Water for all races was relatively flat, with the 1V seeing the best water. All racing was against the tide. Comments: GA and SH fielded three varsity boats; GCDS fielded a 1V and 2V and entered a novice boys boat into the 3V as an exhibition event.
Thanks to SH and GCDS for coming out to race.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Gusty winds for the first 1k-1.1k, cross head coming from NW. Wind gusts up to 32 MPH. Wind increased tremendously throughout racing, 3V race saw the worst of it. Comments: Newton had a 4V so they raced in the 3V category as well. Although wind was not great, everyone had a safe and good race. Thank you Newton for coming!
