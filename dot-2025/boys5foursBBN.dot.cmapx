The 7th and 8th boats raced on the JV course between Northeastern and Eliot Bridge. Boys 7th/8th boats combined into an 8. Thank to Nobles and Groton for making the trip!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed. Comments: Alternated races with girls&#39; teams. Order of boys races: B4, B5, B6, B3, B2, B1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as raced progressed.) Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn&#39;s boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay). That delay and delays in aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning, for boys, with B3 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience. Congratulations to Pomfret Boys and Winsor Girls for winning the 2025 du Pont Cup.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: 8&#45;10 mph direct headwind on the course, remaining fairly consistent throughout the afternoon. Some might chop but generally good conditions &#45; best this spring! Race order 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5&#45;6 Comments: Photo&#45;finish in the G4 event showed a 3&#45;5 inch gap between Brooks and BB&amp;N. Thanks to all the coaches and athletes for making the beautiful afternoon productive on the water. Good luck to all crews in your remaining races.
