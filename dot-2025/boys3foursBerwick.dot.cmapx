Distance: 1500 Conditions: Strong crosswind at the start, becoming protected by the shore as race went on. Flat water conditions. Incoming tide but strong down stream current. Conditions consistent for all races. Comments: Boys 4V was novices and boys 5V was mixed novices. Girls 3V and 4 were novice races. All novice races served as scrimmages to get athletes racing experience. Thank you to all teams for traveling Berwick!
