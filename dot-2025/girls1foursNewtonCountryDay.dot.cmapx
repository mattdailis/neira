Distance: 1400 Conditions: Gusty winds for the first 1k&#45;1.1k, cross head coming from NW. Wind gusts up to 32 MPH. Wind increased tremendously throughout racing, 3V race saw the worst of it. Comments: Newton had a 4V so they raced in the 3V category as well. Although wind was not great, everyone had a safe and good race. Thank you Newton for coming!
