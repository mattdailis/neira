Distance: 1300 Conditions: Great day of racing. Crossing tailwind with a few gusts, but nothing to impede racing or steering. 5th, 6th, 7th boats raced a shortened course due to current and timing restraints. Thank you to Choate for making the trip to Boston and CRLS for a great afternoon of racing!

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Warm, partly cloudy. Steady tailwind ~8&#45;12 mph throughout the afternoon; strongest in the latter 1000 M. Comments: In the G2 race, Berkshire stopped before the finish line and drifted across. Thanks to Choate and Taft for traveling to Camp Sloane for our annual early season tilt.
