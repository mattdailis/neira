Distance: 1500m Conditions: 8&#45;10 mph direct headwind on the course, remaining fairly consistent throughout the afternoon. Some might chop but generally good conditions &#45; best this spring! Race order 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5&#45;6 Comments: Photo&#45;finish in the G4 event showed a 3&#45;5 inch gap between Brooks and BB&amp;N. Thanks to all the coaches and athletes for making the beautiful afternoon productive on the water. Good luck to all crews in your remaining races.
