Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Chilly and cloudy with variable cross headwinds building over the afternoon; strongest in the middle 500. Generally flat water with some slight chop in middle 500. Comments: Order of racing: G3-B4-G2-B3-G1-B2-G4-B1. Berkshire hotseated between G3 and G4. Great to be able to welcome our neighbors to the world of fours racing.
