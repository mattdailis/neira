Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn&#39;s boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay). That delay and delays in aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning, for boys, with B3 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience.
