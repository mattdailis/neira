Distance: 1250m Conditions: Brisk 15&#45;20mph crosswind, swirling and gusting, increasing throughout races. Race order 5&#45;4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1. 
Water mostly ok until significant chop in the middle of the 1V race. 
All floating starts, not exactly the same across races. 5V in particular started more than a length over the line. 
Due to the wind, the 5V, 4V, and 1V races shared the center arches, while 2V and 3V races had one boat in the Boston side arches and the other in the center arches. Comments: BB&amp;N retains the Cambridge Mayor&#39;s Cup as a result of winning the 1V race in the last 5 strokes with an impressive sprint!
Slight mutual blade clashing in the last 500m of the 5V race.
BB&amp;N 2V broke their skeg during their warmup and hot&#45;seated into the 5V crew&#39;s shell.
Congrats to all crews and especially the coxswains for getting lined up and navigating challenging wind conditions and river traffic.
Thanks to BB&amp;N for great early&#45;season racing and flexibility in rescheduling to a weekday afternoon!

Distance: 1400m Conditions: Race order: 2V, 3V, 1V.
2V race rowed into approximately 12 mph cross headwind. Due to the wind, alignment took a little longer, and pushed the race to about 1420m.
3V saw an increase in winds and a pronounced shift to a truer crosswind in the last 400m.
1V had the balmiest conditions, with a weaker cross head.
Water for all races was relatively flat, with the 1V seeing the best water. All racing was against the tide. Comments: GA and SH fielded three varsity boats; GCDS fielded a 1V and 2V and entered a novice boys boat into the 3V as an exhibition event.
Thanks to SH and GCDS for coming out to race.
