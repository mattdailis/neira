Distance: 1500m Conditions: 6-8 mph headwind throughout the course. Mostly cloudy day, more than normal spectator boat traffic causing some wakes to enter the later races. Comments: Lyme/Old Lyme G3V4 raced in the girls 2V4 race. Due to conditions and to avoid having to cause all boats to realign in the B1V4 Lyme/Old Lyme was started approximately a deck down on valley. 
It was a great day of racing weâ€™re glad that valley was able to join us on such a nice day. This was a race with another school Avon but only valley and LOLHS are NEIRA schools. If there is interest the LOL v Valley v Avon will be posted under the high school results.
