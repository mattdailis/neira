    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Moderate tailwind and light chop made for good conditions for all races. Floating starts that all crews handled well. All races started on or above the start. Comments: All races were cleanly contested. Andover's 3rd boys' eight hit a buoy at 1000m, but it did not impact the outcome of the race. The boys' 1st boat race was stopped at 500m due to steering error. The crews went back to the start and had a clean race on the second attempt.\nThank you to the Andover crews and coaches for a great day of racing.\n\nNone",
