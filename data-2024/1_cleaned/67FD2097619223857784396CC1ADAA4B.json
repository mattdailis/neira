    "comment": "\nDistance: 1680 Conditions: A slight tail current with a following tailwind fluctuated as the day progressed. Comments: Race times should not be compared, as some crews started past the starting line.\nAlso, in the B3 race, Salisbury's third boat joined this afternoon. Because of this, we moved the course downstream to remove the turn at the 500m mark and extended it another 3-400 m downstream. By the time the boats were lined up, the course ended up being between 1200m and 1300m. Thank you to BC High and Salisbury for making the trip\n\nNone",
