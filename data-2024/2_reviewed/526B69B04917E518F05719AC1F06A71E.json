    "comment": "\nDistance: 1250m Conditions: Conditions were stable throughout the early part of the afternoon, with little wind and a low-to-moderate current. Regrettably, 5th and 8th boats did not get to race after the onset of a thunderstorm forced all boats off the water. Comments: Also racing were girls 7th boats. Brooks won the G7 race with a time of 4:59. Groton's time was 5:07.\n\nNone",
