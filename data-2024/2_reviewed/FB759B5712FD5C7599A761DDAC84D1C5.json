    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 m Conditions: Competing schools: Kent School, Brunswick, Salisbury, Simsbury, Hotchkiss, Farmington, and East Lyme. Conditions were almost perfect, with a light tailwind. Comments: Thank you to all of the visiting crews and volunteers. There were some very good and close races today. Note: In the girls' 2nd boat race, Hotchkiss caught a blade in the bouy line, causing them to stop for a few strokes at the 700 m mark. They quickly recovered and finished the race.\nSimsbury had to scratch their G2 due to illness and injuries.\n\nNote: In the girls' 2nd boat race, Hotchkiss caught a blade in the bouy line, causing them to stop for a few strokes at the 700 m mark.
