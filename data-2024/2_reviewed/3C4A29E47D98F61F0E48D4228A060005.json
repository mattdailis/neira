    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Strong tailwind throughout. Head current for boys 3v. Boys 2v minimal current as tide shifted. Rest of races variable amount of tail current. Times are not comparable between races. Comments: Novice races (4th boat) and girls 2V were 1000m races due to conditions at the start.\nFarmington scratched novice boys and girls 8s due to rough conditions.\nFor the Stonington boys 4th boat, many rowers were doubled from the 3rd boat.\nFor Girls 2V 8+, some rowers from Stonington 1V doubled.\nThank you to Farmington and Fairfield Prep for making the trip to Mystic!\n\nNone",
