    "comment": "\nDistance: 1300m Conditions: Gusting crosswinds of 15-20mph made for some difficult aligning and patches of sudden choppy water. Comments: Clean racing in the 1V and 2V races. In the 3V race, boats clashed oars under a bridge but it did not affect the outcome. The 4V race started well below the line due to difficulty aligning in the wind.\nThank you to St. Paul's for making the trip (in weekday traffic!) down to Boston and to Belmont Hill as well for joining in. Great racing by all crews.\n\nNone",
