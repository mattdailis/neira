    "comment": "\nDistance: 1650 Conditions: Variable headwind conditions on the course (10-20mph). Strong tail current. Comments: Times should not be compared as crews were starting with a floating start. In the second boat race, crews started about a length past the line. In the B5 race, Andover and Belmont Hill combined to make a composite entry.\nThank you to all crews for making the drive to Andover.\n\nNone",
