    "comment": "\nDistance: Berwick Conditions: Strong head wind gusts in the first 700 meters of the race creating some chop, but generally clean conditions for early April racing. Slightly increasing wind as races progressed. Comments: Race order was Girls 1V, Boys 2V, Girls 2V*,Boys 3V, & Boys 1V**\r\n\r\n*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line-ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.\r\n**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.\r\n\nNone",
