    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: Moderate headwind throughout (5-8 mph) with some variability from race to race.   Light chop. Comments: A beautiful day for early-spring racing.  Thanks to a flexible, enthusiastic and impressive Nobles squad for making the trip up to Brooks.   Good, clean racing across the board.   Note that B4 and B5 were both started with their sterns on the starting line.   \r\n\r\nGood luck Nobles on your season.\r\n\nNone",
