Times should not be compared as crews were started with a floating start and conditions built throughout the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn the B4 race, Andover and St. John's Prep combined rowers to make an entry.\r\n\r\nThank you to Duxbury, Deerfield, and St. John's Prep for making the drive. Great day of racing for all crews.\r\n\nNone",
