    "comment": "\nDistance: 1400 Conditions: Incoming tide and variable cross headwind 8-10 mph.  Times cannot be compared between races.  In the 3rd/4th boat race, Fairfield's 4th impeded and clashed oars with Stonington approximately 300 meters after the start.  All crews were stopped and the race was re-started from that point. Comments: Really good racing across the board between all crews to start the season.  Thanks to Stonington for making the trip.\r\n\nNone",
