    "comment": "\nDistance: 1400 Conditions: Conditions were difficult.  Cross tail wind steady at 15 mph, gusting to 25-30 at times.  Outgoing tide.  Mid course white caps, the later portion of the course was nearly flat conditions. Comments: Race order was 3,2,1,4.  Conditions dictated a shortened course for the 4th boats, they raced 1K.  Starting line for all races was approximate, crews were level but times cannot be compared between races at all.\r\n\r\nA challenging day, thank you to Brunswick and Coach Martin for persevering and taking on the conditions.  Brunswick retains the Kulaga Cup by winning the 3rd and 1st boat races.\r\n\nNone",
