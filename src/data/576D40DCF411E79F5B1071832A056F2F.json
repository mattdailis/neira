    "comment": "\nDistance: 1400m Conditions: Tailwind increasing in intensity as the races progressed. Rain throughout. Race Order GN4, G1V, B1V, BN8, G2V Comments: All floating starts. Races are not comparable. Novice races were about 150m shorter. In the Girls 2nd Varsity race, Guilford's steering wire snapped at 900m. They finished with no steering. East Lyme was ahead by open water when it snapped. Thank you East Lyme for a great day of racing\r\n\nNone",
