    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a  tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.\r\n\nNone",
