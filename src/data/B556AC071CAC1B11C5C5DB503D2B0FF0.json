Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare times.  In the B1 race Tabor caught a boat stopping crab at 300 meters down. In the B4, St. John's \"B\" had 2 boat stopping crabs. Also in the B4, Stonington B3 raced in this event due to illness. A special thank you to St. John's an Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.\r\n\nNone",
