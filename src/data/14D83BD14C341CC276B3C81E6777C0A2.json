    "comment": "\nDistance: Charles River Powerhouse Conditions: moderately strong cross from port, slightly headwind, but since coming from Cambridge side, the racecourse was largely sheltered and the water was good. Comments: BB&N 4th boat's 3 seat popped an oarlock gate and lost their oar about 750m into the race, forcing them to come to a complete stop to replace the oar before continuing.\r\n\r\nA good day of racing, well rowed to Groton and Nobles!\r\n\nNone",
