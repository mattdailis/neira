    "comment": "\nDistance: 1250 m Conditions: Brisk but bright and sunny, 10-15 mph cross-tail wind, becoming more cross and less tail over the afternoon. Order of races was boys/girls, 4/5V, 3V, 2V, 1V. Comments: All floating starts.  Boys' 4/5V race started 1+ length over the line.  \r\n\r\nThe Mayor's Cup trophies for the 1V races stay with BB&N (boys) and CRLS (girls).\r\n\r\nThanks to BB&N and congratulations to all for a great day of early season racing!\r\n\nNone",
