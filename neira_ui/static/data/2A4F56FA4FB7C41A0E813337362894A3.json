    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys \"4V\" even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.\nThe girls \"3V\" was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.\nThank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.\n\nNone",
