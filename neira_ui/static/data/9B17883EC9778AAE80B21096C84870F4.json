    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Rainy intermittently. Very flat water and very little wind. Tail current for all races (less so BV1 and GV1). Comments: Novice boats and girls 2V 8+ were 1000m. The Girls 2V8s from Lyme/Old Lyme and Stonington were exhibition.\nThank you to Lyme/Old Lyme and East Lyme for making the foggy trip to Stonington this morning!\n\nNone",
