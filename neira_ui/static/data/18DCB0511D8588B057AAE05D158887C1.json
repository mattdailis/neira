    "comment": "\nDistance: 1400m Conditions: 15-20 mph headwind. Race Order BN8, GN8, G1V, B2V Comments: All floating starts. Races are not comparable. In the boys novice race, Guilford stopped twice 150m and with a crab with 350m left in the race. In the girls novice race, the 7 seat for East Lyme jumped her slide with 600m to go and rowed without it the race of the way. Thank you East Lyme for a great day of racing.\n\nNone",
