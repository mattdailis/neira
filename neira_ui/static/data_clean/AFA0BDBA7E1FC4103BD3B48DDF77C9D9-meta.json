  "comment": "\nDistance: 1300m Conditions: light winds, great water! Comments: In the 3V8 race, Belmont Hill was ahead but drifted into Exeter's lane after the River Street bridge, forcing Exeter to alter their course. The race was finished, but then re-rowed upstream with the crews going through different arches and the course shortened to approx 1200 meters.\nA great day of racing between the two schools -- thanks to Exeter for making the trip down!\n\nNone",
