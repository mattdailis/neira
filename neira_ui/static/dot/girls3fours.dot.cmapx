Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15&#45;25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Swirling, gusty winds &#45; 12 to 15MPH, with stronger gusts. Slight tail at the start for first 300 meters, switching to a crossing through 800M mark, then crossing headwind, some strong crossing gusts. Despite the wind, not much chop on the water. Comments: Order of Races, G2, G1, G3 with boys&#39; races in between. Marianapolis raced their 2nd boat in the third boat race. Pomfret raced both their 3rd and 4th boats in that race.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.

Distance: 1350 M Conditions: Good conditions all day, even across lanes Comments: Good racing by all, in the 1V Nobles drifted in to the BB&amp;N lane in the last 100 meters, then cut back out, finish order was not impacted but margin was.
Girls 7th, 8th and 9th for BB&amp;N and Nobles raced in the JV course, Great to see everyone out there.

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Flat water; light, variable headwind in first 1000 meters, then calm. Comments: B3: Taft left their lane, interfered with Berkshire, then corrected, but then crossed Choate&#39;s lane in the last 250 M. Did not change placement, but Berkshire&#39;s margin over Choate might have been larger without the interference.
Thanks to Taft and Choate for some great racing in ideal conditions.
