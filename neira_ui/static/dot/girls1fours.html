Lyme/Old Lyme would like thank Middletown and Mills for coming out to race on our lake. We are always excited to have teams come and visit and enjoy our facility with us.
Thank you for a great day of racing and we look forward to seeing you all again soon!!

Water was choppy after the first 500M all the way to finish line. Comments: Race order: G4, G3, G2, G1 (with boys' races interspersed). Winds made aligning starts challenging. Commendable job by aligner. Course steering was challenging for almost all crews. Wind also affected crews as many drifted into other lanes, though no significant impediments that impacted finish order were detected. Taft's 1st boat was a late scratch.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: All races experienced strong tailwinds. Wind was 15mph with strong gusts. The wind increased as the Boys 2V boat went down the course and the race was paused. Once conditions died back to 15mph races resumed. Once conditions died back down to a 15-17 tail wind, races resumed. Comments: Race order was Boys Novice, Girls Novice/Novice Mix, B3v, B2V, G1V, B1V. For recording purposes Boys Novice will be recorded as the Boys fourth boat. The girls novice/novice mix will be recorded as GV2 (please note the novice mix boat (Eagle Hill) was a mix of talent and more of a friendly race to get rowers to race).

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.
