Distance: 1500m Conditions: At the start, crossing tailwinds of ~10MPH. Winds shifted to a mostly tail after first 500M of ~15MPH, with occasional gusts 20 to 25. Water was choppy after the first 500M all the way to finish line. Comments: Race order: G4, G3, G2, G1 (with boys' races interspersed). Winds made aligning starts challenging. Commendable job by aligner. Course steering was challenging for almost all crews. Wind also affected crews as many drifted into other lanes, though no significant impediments that impacted finish order were detected. Taft's 1st boat was a late scratch.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Very light wind, perhaps slight crossing WSW tail at times of no more than 5MPH. Conditions similar throughout, with a slight tailwind developing in the last race. No current. Comments: Race order: G3, G2, G1, G4/5. Thanks to NMH and Hopkins for a great day of racing.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Swirling, gusty winds - 12 to 15MPH, with stronger gusts. Slight tail at the start for first 300 meters, switching to a crossing through 800M mark, then crossing headwind, some strong crossing gusts. Despite the wind, not much chop on the water. Comments: Order of Races, G2, G1, G3 with boys' races in between. Marianapolis raced their 2nd boat in the third boat race. Pomfret raced both their 3rd and 4th boats in that race.
