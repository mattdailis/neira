Distance: 1300 Conditions: Good water with swirling winds &#45;&#45; sometimes cross&#45;head, sometimes cross&#45;tail, sometimes straight cross, varying race&#45;to&#45;race. Comments: The 3V4 race was action&#45;packed: MX caught an over&#45;the&#45;head, boat&#45;stopping crab just over a minute into the race, while the 3&#45;seat of the BHS crew had his oar pop out of his oarlock not once but twice during the race; these incidents caused stoppages of significant duration for both crews. An oarsman in the CRLS 1V4 tested positive for Covid prior to the race and the crew was thus unable to compete today.
Thanks to Middlesex and CRLS for a great day of racing on the Charles!

Winds made aligning starts challenging. Commendable job by aligner. B2 crews were roughly 30ft. over the line at the start. Course steering was challenging for almost all crews.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12&#45;14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short&#45;lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3&#45;G4&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B1&#45;G2&#45;G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren&#39;t comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.

In the G6 race, Hanover cut the turn buoy which is grounds for a disqualification.
In the B4 race, Hanover caught multiple boat&#45;stopping crabs.
Thank you to all crews for making the trip. And special thank you to the athletes willing to double up or create composite crews to get everyone on the water today.

The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.

A very light headwind for later races.

This did not affect the order of finish but did have an effect on margins. Both boats handled the situation well once within it.
5th boats raced on the Powerhouse course approximately 2 hours earlier than Varsity racing.
NOTE: 6th, 7th boat races took place on the Charles River JV course, from Northeastern to the Kayak Pavilion.
BB&amp;N and Nobles also raced their 7th and 8th boat crews in eights, a race which was slightly shorter due to a restart.
Times for this race were:
Nobles: 2:22.3
BB&amp;N: 2:30.1
many thanks to all crews and coaches for a great day of racing for full teams.

Distance: 1350m Conditions: Excellent conditions.
Cloudy and cool
Mostly flat water.
A very light headwind for later races. Comments: In boys 4th boat race, Groton and BB&amp;N clashed blades for roughly the first 20 strokes due to Groton moving into BB&amp;N&#39;s lane off the start. This did not affect the order of finish but did have an effect on margins. Both boats handled the situation well once within it.
5th boats raced on the Powerhouse course approximately 2 hours earlier than Varsity racing.
NOTE: 6th, 7th boat races took place on the Charles River JV course, from Northeastern to the Kayak Pavilion.
BB&amp;N and Nobles also raced their 7th and 8th boat crews in eights, a race which was slightly shorter due to a restart.
Times for this race were:
Nobles: 2:22.3
BB&amp;N: 2:30.1
many thanks to all crews and coaches for a great day of racing for full teams.
