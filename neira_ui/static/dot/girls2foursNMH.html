Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12-14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short-lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3-G4-B2-G1-B1-G2-G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren't comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.
