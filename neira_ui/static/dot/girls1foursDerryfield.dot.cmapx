Distance: 1500m Conditions: Calm conditions, tail current. Comments: Bedford racing as non&#45;NEIRA school for this event (because they race 8+s at NEIRA&#39;s). Thayer fielded only a G2 boat for the event.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.
