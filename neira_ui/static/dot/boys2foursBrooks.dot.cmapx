Distance: 1500m Conditions: Conditions evolved from a slight headwind with flat water to a 12&#45;15 mph cross headwind with significant chop in the middle 500m. Races were 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5. Times should bet be compared between events. Comments: Thank you to our guests for our first bog day using the new facility! Good luck this season and hope to see you at NEIRAs.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Partly cloudy, with variable winds switching from cross&#45;wind to cross&#45;tail 8&#45;12mph. Quite calm for 4th boat races, picked up during 1V and 2V races. Comments: Times for G3 weren&#39;t started until about 650m in, so we got margins only.

Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15&#45;25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.
