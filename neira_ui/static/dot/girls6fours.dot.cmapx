Distance: 1250m Conditions: Conditions were stable throughout the early part of the afternoon, with little wind and a low&#45;to&#45;moderate current. Regrettably, 5th and 8th boats did not get to race after the onset of a thunderstorm forced all boats off the water. Comments: Also racing were girls 7th boats. Brooks won the G7 race with a time of 4:59. Groton&#39;s time was 5:07.

Distance: 1300 Conditions: Flat and equal conditions across all races. Steering in 3V race resulted in both crews finishing off the course with an indistinguishable margin (deemed a tie). 4V crews reversed lanes mid&#45;race, potentially impacting margin but not finish order. 5th and 6th boats were composite to provide a race for all athletes. Thank you to BB&amp;N for a fun race!
