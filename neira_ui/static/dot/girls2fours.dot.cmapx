Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15&#45;25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.

Distance: 1650 Conditions: Strong following current.Variable 15&#45;20mph cross tailwind gusting to 30mph. Comments: Times should not be compared given the strong current and floating start. In the boys&#39; third boat, times were not taken but margins were recorded &#45; the margin is recorded as time from the winning crew.
Andover wins the Perry and Brown Trophy (Boys&#39; 1st boat) and Kent wins the Hart Perry Cup (Girls&#39; 1st boat).
Thank you to Kent for making the long drive and a great day of racing.
