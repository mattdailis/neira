Distance: 1500 Conditions: Variable headwind, started out light for G4 and B4 races and gradually built up to a steady headwind, especially at the last 500m. Gusts up to 15mph at moments. Comments: Races were all started on the line and it was a great day on the Lake. Thanks to all the crews who came out to race!

Distance: 1350 M Conditions: Good conditions all day, even across lanes Comments: Good racing by all, in the 1V Nobles drifted in to the BB&amp;N lane in the last 100 meters, then cut back out, finish order was not impacted but margin was.
Girls 7th, 8th and 9th for BB&amp;N and Nobles raced in the JV course, Great to see everyone out there.

Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15&#45;25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.
