Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12&#45;14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short&#45;lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3&#45;G4&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B1&#45;G2&#45;G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren&#39;t comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Conditions evolved from a slight headwind with flat water to a 12&#45;15 mph cross headwind with significant chop in the middle 500m. Races were 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1&#45;5. Times should bet be compared between events. Comments: Thank you to our guests for our first bog day using the new facility! Good luck this season and hope to see you at NEIRAs.
