Distance: 1650 Conditions: Strong following current.Variable 15&#45;20mph cross tailwind gusting to 30mph. Comments: Times should not be compared given the strong current and floating start. In the boys&#39; third boat, times were not taken but margins were recorded &#45; the margin is recorded as time from the winning crew.
Andover wins the Perry and Brown Trophy (Boys&#39; 1st boat) and Kent wins the Hart Perry Cup (Girls&#39; 1st boat).
Thank you to Kent for making the long drive and a great day of racing.
