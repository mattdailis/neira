Distance: 1500 Conditions: Variable headwind, started out light for G4 and B4 races and gradually built up to a steady headwind, especially at the last 500m. Gusts up to 15mph at moments. Comments: Races were all started on the line and it was a great day on the Lake. Thanks to all the crews who came out to race!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Partly cloudy, with variable winds switching from cross-wind to cross-tail 8-12mph. Quite calm for 4th boat races, picked up during 1V and 2V races. Comments: Times for G3 weren't started until about 650m in, so we got margins only.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12-14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short-lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3-G4-B2-G1-B1-G2-G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren't comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.
