Distance: 1500m Conditions: Swirling, gusty winds &#45; 12 to 15MPH, with stronger gusts. Slight tail at the start for first 300 meters, switching to a crossing through 800M mark, then crossing headwind, some strong crossing gusts. Despite the wind, not much chop on the water. Comments: Order of Races, G2, G1, G3 with boys&#39; races in between. Marianapolis raced their 2nd boat in the third boat race. Pomfret raced both their 3rd and 4th boats in that race.
