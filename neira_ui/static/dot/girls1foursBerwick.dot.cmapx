Distance: 1500 Conditions: Tail Current with a strong tail/cross wind with occasional gusts. Fun conditions for first race of the season! Thank you for Brewster for making the trip. Comments: Mixed boats were exhibition events and a combo of boys and girls of various skill levels &#45; anything to get some new rowers more racing experience!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.
