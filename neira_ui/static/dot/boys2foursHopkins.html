Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Overcast, 60 deg., calm for first 500, then very light (5 mph) and variable tail wind for latter 1000 M. Flat water throughout. Comments: Order of racing: G1, G2, B2, B1, G3, B4, B3, G4/nov. Berkshire doubled a rower from G2 to G4 (all-novice boat); Hopkins and Lyme doubled rowers from G3 to G4. B1: Berkshire and LOL encroached on Hopkins' lane approaching the finish, but Hopkins was judged to be too far back to have been impeded. G4: Lyme and Hopkins clashed oars briefly 300 meters from the finish, then separated. Lyme stopped a couple of strokes short of the line. Thanks to visiting teams for traveling, and to the coxswains for their generally excellent work.
