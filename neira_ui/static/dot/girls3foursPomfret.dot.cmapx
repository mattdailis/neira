Conditions: Some cross wind in the first 500m shifting into a light tail wind in the last 1k. Teams with multiple boats in a single event only progressed the faster boat even if both finished top 3." alt="" coords="1261,54,1251,91,1241,109,1227,124,1193,136,1134,146,965,160,775,167,618,170,618,165,775,162,965,154,1133,141,1192,131,1224,119,1237,106,1246,89,1255,53"/>
