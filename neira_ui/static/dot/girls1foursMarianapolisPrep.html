Slight tail at the start for first 300 meters, switching to a crossing through 800M mark, then crossing headwind, some strong crossing gusts. Despite the wind, not much chop on the water. Comments: Order of Races, G2, G1, G3 with boys' races in between. Marianapolis raced their 2nd boat in the third boat race. Pomfret raced both their 3rd and 4th boats in that race.
