Distance: 1500m Conditions: Variable headwind. Strongest during the Girls and Boys 2nd boat races. Water was mostly flat in the middle third of the course, with more chop in the first and last 500m. Again strongest during the 2nd boat races. Comments: Good job by the coxswains and the aligner working with some tricky wind at the starting line. Race order G4-B4-G3-B3-G2-B2-G1-B1. Finish order in the G3 race confirmed by camera at the finish line. Well rowed by all crews. Thank you CRLS for joining us for a great afternoon of racing!
