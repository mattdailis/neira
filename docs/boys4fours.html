Distance: Charles River Powerhouse Conditions: moderately strong cross from port, slightly headwind, but since coming from Cambridge side, the racecourse was largely sheltered and the water was good. Comments: BB&amp;N 4th boat's 3 seat popped an oarlock gate and lost their oar about 750m into the race, forcing them to come to a complete stop to replace the oar before continuing.
A good day of racing, well rowed to Groton and Nobles!

Note that B4 and B5 were both started with their sterns on the starting line. 
Good luck Nobles on your season.

The Mayor's Cup trophies for the 1V races stay with BB&amp;N (boys) and CRLS (girls).

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.
