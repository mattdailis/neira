Distance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Light wind changing throughout the day, starting as a tailwind, then a cross&#45;wind and finishing the day as headwind. Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare times. In the B1 race Tabor caught a boat stopping crab at 300 meters down. In the B4, St. John&#39;s B had 2 boat stopping crabs. Also in the B4, Stonington B3 raced in this event due to illness. A special thank you to St. John&#39;s an Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.

Thanks to Tabor for making the trip up north to SPS.
