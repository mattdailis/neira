  "comment": "\nDistance: 1650 Conditions: Tail current. Flat water. Light crosswind. Great racing conditions. Comments: Times should not be compared - the B3 race started a length plus past the starting line, the G4 race started well below the starting line.\nThank you to all the crews for great competition and sportsmanship. Good luck this season!\n\nNone",
