  "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Light cross-tailwind coming from lane 1, increasing throughout the day. Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare time. In the G3 the Exeter bow seat crabbed and popped her oar. She recovered and then it happened again about 150 meters later. Also, in the G3 the Simsbury bow seat popped an oar in the last 100 meters. The Kent/Exeter Points Trophy was a tie this year, both names will go on the trophy. A special thank you to St. John's and Shrewsbury for hosting the day.\n\nNone",
