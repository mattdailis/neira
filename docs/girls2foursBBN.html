Distance: 1250 m Conditions: Brisk but bright and sunny, 10-15 mph cross-tail wind, becoming more cross and less tail over the afternoon. Order of races was boys/girls, 4/5V, 3V, 2V, 1V. Comments: All floating starts. Boys' 4/5V race started 1+ length over the line. 
The Mayor's Cup trophies for the 1V races stay with BB&amp;N (boys) and CRLS (girls).
Thanks to BB&amp;N and congratulations to all for a great day of early season racing!
