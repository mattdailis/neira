Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Great conditions on Lake Q - 8-10mph crosswind at beginning of races, tapering to 6-8mph by end of the racing. Very nice water. Comments: Races were started within 10m of the line (before or after), except for G1 which was over a boat length over the line. Thank you to all the visiting coaches who helped on the water today with timing and marshaling. The rain held off and we had a great afternoon of racing.
