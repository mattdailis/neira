Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10 mph cross&#45;tail for the 2V and 1V races, considerably less for the 3V race. Comments: Order was 2V, 1V, 3V. 
In the 1V race, Andover steered into Deerfield at the 500m mark when they were level with each other. Both crews lost a stroke or two but recovered well. The coaches did not believe it affected the outcome of the race.
Despite the aligning difficulties and the collision, it was an exciting and productive first race of the season. It was great to see everyone again&#45;&#45;thanks to Andover and Deerfield for making the trip.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10 mph cross&#45;tail for the 2V and 1V races, considerably less for the 3V race. Comments: Order was 2V, 1V, 3V. 
In the 1V race, Andover steered into Deerfield at the 500m mark when they were level with each other. Both crews lost a stroke or two but recovered well. The coaches did not believe it affected the outcome of the race.
Despite the aligning difficulties and the collision, it was an exciting and productive first race of the season. It was great to see everyone again&#45;&#45;thanks to Andover and Deerfield for making the trip.

Distance: 1275m Conditions: All races were against an incoming tide. Stong crosswind created significant chop, especially in the final 500m. Comments: Thank you to Deerfield for rescheduling and making the trip.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Incoming tide and variable cross headwind 8&#45;10 mph. Times cannot be compared between races. In the 3rd/4th boat race, Fairfield&#39;s 4th impeded and clashed oars with Stonington approximately 300 meters after the start. All crews were stopped and the race was re&#45;started from that point. Comments: Really good racing across the board between all crews to start the season. Thanks to Stonington for making the trip.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Conditions were difficult. Cross tail wind steady at 15 mph, gusting to 25&#45;30 at times. Outgoing tide. Mid course white caps, the later portion of the course was nearly flat conditions. Comments: Race order was 3,2,1,4. Conditions dictated a shortened course for the 4th boats, they raced 1K. Starting line for all races was approximate, crews were level but times cannot be compared between races at all.
A challenging day, thank you to Brunswick and Coach Martin for persevering and taking on the conditions. Brunswick retains the Kulaga Cup by winning the 3rd and 1st boat races.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Flat water conditions, outgoing tide, cross tail wind 5&#45;7 mph. Comments: Time cannot be compared between races as the tide made starting at the line each time challenging, so while they were even bows, the line varied.
Race order was 3rd, 1st, 2nd then 4th. In the 4th boat race crews clashed and had to stop after the start, the race was restarted from that point. St. John&#39;s caught a boat stopping crab less than 300 meters from the finish, they recovered and completed the race.
Thanks to St. John&#39;s Prep for the long trip to Black Rock.
