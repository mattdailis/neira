Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Great conditions on Lake Q &#45; 8&#45;10mph crosswind at beginning of races, tapering to 6&#45;8mph by end of the racing. Very nice water. Comments: Races were started within 10m of the line (before or after), except for G1 which was over a boat length over the line. Thank you to all the visiting coaches who helped on the water today with timing and marshaling. The rain held off and we had a great afternoon of racing.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1&#45;B4&#45;G4&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B2&#45;G2&#45;B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Order of racing: G2, G3/G4 (raced together). 8mph crosswind for the G2 race; 10&#45;12 mph for the G3/G4 race; shifting around to a cross tail wind for the final 350 meters or so in both races. Comments: The G3/G4 race needed three tries to get a clean race going. Good work by novice coxswains to get their boats aligned in a crosswind. During the race, the GA 3V caught a boat&#45;stopping crab with 350 meters left; they were leading all boats until that point in the race. 
The G1 race was canceled at the starting line because of lightning. 
Thank you to all the coaches, coxswains, and rowers for getting twelve shells off the water in record time.

Distance: 1250m Conditions: Windy, with conditions in the last 500m getting progressively choppier through the day. Strong cross&#45;tailwind for all races. Comments: Race order went 3V&#45;1V&#45;2V&#45;4V. Due to high winds, racing was shortened to 1100m for the 2V race and 1000m for the 4V race.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Floating start made the overall distance vary slightly. Overcast, with strong gusty cross headwind worsening from 9 to 14 mph in the later races, significant chop in the first third of the course. Comments: Top boats raced first followed by lower boats. Lyme/Old Lyme B3 and G4, Hopkins G3 and G4 boats were novices. Wet launch at 56F water stirred excitement! Challenging conditions caused Hopkins B3 and G3 boats, LOL G2, G3, and G4 to miss the turn buoys and row a shorter course. Thank you, LOL and NMH for coming to our home river. We look forward to hosting you again next year!
