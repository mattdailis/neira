Distance: 1250m Conditions: Windy, with conditions in the last 500m getting progressively choppier through the day. Strong cross&#45;tailwind for all races. Comments: Race order went 3V&#45;1V&#45;2V&#45;4V. Due to high winds, racing was shortened to 1100m for the 2V race and 1000m for the 4V race.
A big thanks to Valley Regional for making the trip to Greenwich!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Order of racing: G2, G3/G4 (raced together). 8mph crosswind for the G2 race; 10&#45;12 mph for the G3/G4 race; shifting around to a cross tail wind for the final 350 meters or so in both races. Comments: The G3/G4 race needed three tries to get a clean race going. Good work by novice coxswains to get their boats aligned in a crosswind. During the race, the GA 3V caught a boat&#45;stopping crab with 350 meters left; they were leading all boats until that point in the race. 
The G1 race was canceled at the starting line because of lightning. 
Thank you to all the coaches, coxswains, and rowers for getting twelve shells off the water in record time.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Strong cross wind throughout racing , slight headwind. Tide incoming against course for boys 1v, none for girls 1v and outgoing with course rest of races. Not comparable times across races. Comments: Novice races were 1000m. In the girls 2v race, a Farmington rowerâ€™s oar came out of the oarlock in the last 250m of the race. In the boys novice, East Lyme caught a crab off the start. Stonington and East Lyme raced an exhibition 4+ event. 
Thank you so much to East Lyme and Farmington for making the trip to Mystic!
