Distance: 1500m Conditions: Order of racing: G2, G3/G4 (raced together). 8mph crosswind for the G2 race; 10-12 mph for the G3/G4 race; shifting around to a cross tail wind for the final 350 meters or so in both races. Comments: The G3/G4 race needed three tries to get a clean race going. Good work by novice coxswains to get their boats aligned in a crosswind. During the race, the GA 3V caught a boat-stopping crab with 350 meters left; they were leading all boats until that point in the race. 
The G1 race was canceled at the starting line because of lightning. 
Thank you to all the coaches, coxswains, and rowers for getting twelve shells off the water in record time.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Great conditions on Lake Q - 8-10mph crosswind at beginning of races, tapering to 6-8mph by end of the racing. Very nice water. Comments: Races were started within 10m of the line (before or after), except for G1 which was over a boat length over the line. Thank you to all the visiting coaches who helped on the water today with timing and marshaling. The rain held off and we had a great afternoon of racing.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.
