Distance: 1490 M Conditions: Overcast, mid&#45;50s. Variable, gusty wind; crosswind to quartering tail, 10&#45;12 mph; mostly affecting latter half of the course. Comments: Great to have all three programs racing together again for the first time since 2019. Thanks to Choate and Taft for traveling and handling facilities issues.

Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.

Distance: Berwick Conditions: Strong head wind gusts in the first 700 meters of the race creating some chop, but generally clean conditions for early April racing. Slightly increasing wind as races progressed. Comments: Race order was Girls 1V, Boys 2V, Girls 2V*,Boys 3V, &amp; Boys 1V**
*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line&#45;ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.
**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Strong cross wind throughout racing , slight headwind. Tide incoming against course for boys 1v, none for girls 1v and outgoing with course rest of races.

Distance: 1680m Conditions: Conditions varied throughout the afternoon due to a storm system moving into the valley. Slight tail current with headwinds ranging in strength from 91&#45;12 mph in the lower boats and up to 15 mph and gusts over 25 mph in the first boat boy&#39;s race. Comments: Thank you to Andover for coming to Kent today for a great day of racing. Kudos go to all athletes for being flexible in the schedule as the threat of bad weather approached. You should not compare times between different races, as each race started at a slightly different point due to the winds.
