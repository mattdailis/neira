Distance: 1500m Conditions: Tailwind picked up through racing and slight tail current. Order of racing was BV1, GV1, BV2 Comments: The Girls 1V race and the Boys 2V race was slightly shorter than 1500 due to crosswind creating difficulty with alignment.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Incoming tide and variable cross headwind 8-10 mph. Times cannot be compared between races. In the 3rd/4th boat race, Fairfield's 4th impeded and clashed oars with Stonington approximately 300 meters after the start. All crews were stopped and the race was re-started from that point. Comments: Really good racing across the board between all crews to start the season. Thanks to Stonington for making the trip.
