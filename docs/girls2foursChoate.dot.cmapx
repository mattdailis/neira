Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.

Distance: 1490 M Conditions: Overcast, mid&#45;50s. Variable, gusty wind; crosswind to quartering tail, 10&#45;12 mph; mostly affecting latter half of the course. Comments: Great to have all three programs racing together again for the first time since 2019. Thanks to Choate and Taft for traveling and handling facilities issues.
