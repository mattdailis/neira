Congratulations St. Mark's Boys and Winsor Girls. Order of races: G6, B5/6, G5, B3, G4, B4, G3, B2, G2, B1, G1.

Distance: 1300m Conditions: Flat water, light and variable cross/ cross-tail wind. Short rainshower at the beginning of the Novice 8+ race. Comments: All floating starts. 3V4+, 4V4+, and N8+ all started over the start line by 1-2 lengths so times are not comparable across events. The Charles Riverboat cruised through the 3V race waking both crews, CRLS slightly more than Winsor, but the result was not affected thanks to some steely-nerved coxswains.
Thank you to Winsor for great racing amid a busy week of AP exams!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Slight Head wind, that lessened as races went on, some current and water level dropped during races
THanks to BBN and NCDS for racing on a sunny day on the Concord River Comments: Race order, 6,5,2,4,3,1 6th had breakage and a restart, and some missed buoys 
 2nd boats had a delay due to an ill athlete
3rd boat missed a buoy and crossed in front of another crew, but ahead enough to not interfere in progress of that crew, so margin would be less but result not
5,3,2,4 started over the line, 4ht a full length
2 and First had some close oar clashes, but nothing that stopped a boat.
