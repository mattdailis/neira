Distance: 1500 Conditions: Moderate headwind throughout (5-8 mph) with some variability from race to race. Light chop. Comments: A beautiful day for early-spring racing. Thanks to a flexible, enthusiastic and impressive Nobles squad for making the trip up to Brooks. Good, clean racing across the board. Note that B4 and B5 were both started with their sterns on the starting line. 
Good luck Nobles on your season.

Distance: 1300m Conditions: Flat water, light and variable cross/ cross-tail wind. Short rainshower at the beginning of the Novice 8+ race. Comments: All floating starts. 3V4+, 4V4+, and N8+ all started over the start line by 1-2 lengths so times are not comparable across events. The Charles Riverboat cruised through the 3V race waking both crews, CRLS slightly more than Winsor, but the result was not affected thanks to some steely-nerved coxswains.
