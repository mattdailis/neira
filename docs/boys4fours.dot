Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.

Distance: Charles River Powerhouse Conditions: moderately strong cross from port, slightly headwind, but since coming from Cambridge side, the racecourse was largely sheltered and the water was good. Comments: BB&N 4th boat's 3 seat popped an oarlock gate and lost their oar about 750m into the race, forcing them to come to a complete stop to replace the oar before continuing.
A good day of racing, well rowed to Groton and Nobles!
