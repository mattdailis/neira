Distance: 1500 Conditions: Moderate headwind throughout (5-8 mph) with some variability from race to race. Light chop. Comments: A beautiful day for early-spring racing. Thanks to a flexible, enthusiastic and impressive Nobles squad for making the trip up to Brooks. Good, clean racing across the board. Note that B4 and B5 were both started with their sterns on the starting line. 
Good luck Nobles on your season.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1-B4-G4-B3-G3-B2-G2-B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.
