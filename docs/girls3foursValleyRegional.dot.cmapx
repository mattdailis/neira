Distance: 1250m Conditions: Windy, with conditions in the last 500m getting progressively choppier through the day. Strong cross&#45;tailwind for all races. Comments: Race order went 3V&#45;1V&#45;2V&#45;4V. Due to high winds, racing was shortened to 1100m for the 2V race and 1000m for the 4V race.
A big thanks to Valley Regional for making the trip to Greenwich!
