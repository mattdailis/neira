    "comment": "\nDistance: approx. 1300m Conditions: Conditions were consistent for all races with a 10 mph cross tailwind from the southwest. Water was calm for the first 400 meters, light chop for the remainder of the course. Comments: All races were floating starts which resulted in a course that varied 10-20m between races--times should not be compared between events. The only circumstance out of the ordinary was in the 3V race when Hingham caught a crab with about 150m to go and finished the race by 6. Great day of racing, thank you to Hingham for making the trip up to Chebacco.\n\nNone",
