    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Moderate crosswind that turned to moderate headwind over the course of the racing. Slight chop and partly cloudy skies. All in all, a good day to race. All races were floating starts, and all races started pretty much on the starting line. Comments: The crews were well prepared, and all three races were cleanly contested. Thank you to Tabor athletes and coaches for making the trip up to Turkey Pond.\n\nNone",
