Distance: 1500m Conditions: Great conditions on Lake Q &#45; 8&#45;10mph crosswind at beginning of races, tapering to 6&#45;8mph by end of the racing. Very nice water. Comments: Races were started within 10m of the line (before or after), except for G1 which was over a boat length over the line. Thank you to all the visiting coaches who helped on the water today with timing and marshaling. The rain held off and we had a great afternoon of racing.
