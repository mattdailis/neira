Towards the end there was noticeably more current with the crews. Comments: Monsoon conditions after the first boat races. It really rained! A couple of races had crashes at the start and had to be re-started. 3rd boat boys started a length over the line.
Thank you for the racing ST. Mark's!
Another great day of racing on the mighty Nashua!
