Distance: 1250 Conditions: Flat water, slight headwind. Comments: The 4V race started downstream of the start. Thank you to St. John&#39;s Prep and Coach Broderick for making the trip and the great racing, especially in the 1V race which came right down to the wire.

Distance: 1250 Conditions: Blustery conditions, 12&#45;15mph crosswind Comments: Challenging conditions to align boats, as the 3V and 2V races started below the line; times should be compared between races. Lower/novice crews raced in fours. Thanks to Brookline for a spirited morning of racing on the windy Charles!
