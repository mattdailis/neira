Distance: 1250 Conditions: Blustery conditions, 12&#45;15mph crosswind Comments: Challenging conditions to align boats, as the 3V and 2V races started below the line; times should be compared between races. Lower/novice crews raced in fours. Thanks to Brookline for a spirited morning of racing on the windy Charles!
