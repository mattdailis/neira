05/11", weight="9", tooltip="NEIRA Boys & Girls Fours,Lyme/Old Lyme v Middletown v East Lyme			
Distance: 1500 Conditions: The wind was 6 to 9 knots dropping slightly towards the end of the day as a cross headwind. The girls first and second boats both started two length past the starting line. The crosswind at the start was quite challenging and caused a number of issues trying to get off the line cleanly in the girls races. In the 3rd boat race East Lymes steering boke pulling them from the race Comments: Lyme/Old Lyme would like to thank Middletown and east Lyme for coming out and racing. We look forward to see you all on the water again!!
