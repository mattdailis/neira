04/22", weight="69", tooltip="NEIRA Girls Fours,Greenwich Academy vs. Valley Regional			
Distance: 1250m Conditions: Windy, with conditions in the last 500m getting progressively choppier through the day. Strong cross-tailwind for all races. Comments: Race order went 3V-1V-2V-4V. Due to high winds, racing was shortened to 1100m for the 2V race and 1000m for the 4V race.
A big thanks to Valley Regional for making the trip to Greenwich!
