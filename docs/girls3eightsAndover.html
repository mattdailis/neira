Distance: 1650m Conditions: Following current, 10-15mph headwind. Comments: Order of racing: G2, B3, G1, B2, B1, G3, B4, G4. Times should not be compared as crews were started with a floating start and conditions built throughout the afternoon.
In the B4 race, Andover and St. John's Prep combined rowers to make an entry.
Thank you to Duxbury, Deerfield, and St. John's Prep for making the drive. Great day of racing for all crews.
