Distance: 1300m Conditions: Gusty tail/cross-tail, which made for tricky aligning at the start, but great racing conditions. Terrific job by all the coxswains navigating three-across racing on the Powerhouse! Comments: The 2V4 race started slightly over the line. Thanks to Brooks & Groton for an exciting afternoon of tight racing!
