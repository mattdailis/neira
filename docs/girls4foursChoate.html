Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.

NEIRA Boys and Girls Fours Conditions: It was a beautiful day for racing on Lake Waramaug. A light breeze prevailed for the majority of the day with a moderately strong headwind for the final 750m at the end of the morning heats. The temperature was 68 to 73 degrees. Many thanks to all the participating teams and their coaches."/>
