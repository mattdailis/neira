Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10 mph cross&#45;tail for the 2V and 1V races, considerably less for the 3V race. Comments: Order was 2V, 1V, 3V. 
In the 1V race, Andover steered into Deerfield at the 500m mark when they were level with each other. Both crews lost a stroke or two but recovered well. The coaches did not believe it affected the outcome of the race.
Despite the aligning difficulties and the collision, it was an exciting and productive first race of the season. It was great to see everyone again&#45;&#45;thanks to Andover and Deerfield for making the trip.
