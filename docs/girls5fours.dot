 2nd boats had a delay due to an ill athlete
3rd boat missed a buoy and crossed in front of another crew, but ahead enough to not interfere in progress of that crew, so margin would be less but result not

Winsor -> CRLS[label="8.5 (9.81)
05/11", weight="92", tooltip="NEIRA Girls Fours,Cambridge Rindge & Latin School vs. Winsor			
Distance: 1300m Conditions: Flat water, light and variable cross/ cross-tail wind. Short rainshower at the beginning of the Novice 8+ race. Comments: All floating starts. 3V4+, 4V4+, and N8+ all started over the start line by 1-2 lengths so times are not comparable across events. The Charles Riverboat cruised through the 3V race waking both crews, CRLS slightly more than Winsor, but the result was not affected thanks to some steely-nerved coxswains.
Thank you to Winsor for great racing amid a busy week of AP exams!
