*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line-ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.
**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Floating start made the overall distance vary slightly. Overcast, with strong gusty head and cross wind worsening from 9 to 14mph in the later races, significant chop in the first half of the course. Comments: Top boats raced first followed by lower boats. Lyme/Old Lyme B3 and G4, Hopkins G3 and G4 boats were novices. Wet launch at 56F water stirred excitement! Several boats missed the turn buoys taking a shortcut through the return lane, so to our regret their final results were disqualified by the chief referee. Thank you, LOL and NMH for coming to our home river. We look forward to hosting you again next year!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Floating start made the overall distance vary slightly. Overcast, with strong gusty head and cross wind worsening from 9 to 14mph in the later races, significant chop in the first half of the course. Comments: Top boats raced first followed by lower boats. Lyme/Old Lyme B3 and G4, Hopkins G3 and G4 boats were novices. Wet launch at 56F water stirred excitement! Several boats missed the turn buoys taking a shortcut through the return lane, so to our regret their final results were disqualified by the chief referee. Thank you, LOL and NMH for coming to our home river. We look forward to hosting you again next year!

Distance: 1680m Conditions: Conditions varied throughout the afternoon due to a storm system moving into the valley. Slight tail current with headwinds ranging in strength from 91-12 mph in the lower boats and up to 15 mph and gusts over 25 mph in the first boat boy's race. Comments: Thank you to Andover for coming to Kent today for a great day of racing. Kudos go to all athletes for being flexible in the schedule as the threat of bad weather approached. You should not compare times between different races, as each race started at a slightly different point due to the winds.

Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.
