Distance: 1500m Conditions: A perfect day at Lake Quinsigamund, just gray enough for no pleasure boats and a tailwind that picked up a bit over the course of the racing period. Comments: Race order was G1&#45;B4&#45;G4&#45;B3&#45;G3&#45;B2&#45;G2&#45;B1. Most races started a length over the line except for G2. Thank you to Brooks and Middlesex for coming to Worcester for some great racing.

Distance: 1300 Conditions: Considerable cross tailwind throughout racing, slightly diminishing throughout the afternoon. Order of racing was 4, 3 , 2 , 1. During the 4v race, a power boat caused the crews to divert courses slightly and handle a wake, but did not impact overall results.
