Distance: 1250m Conditions: As the rain intensified throughout the day, the river gained current. The order of races was G1,B1, G2, B2, G3, B3, G4, B4. Towards the end there was noticeably more current with the crews. Comments: Monsoon conditions after the first boat races. It really rained! A couple of races had crashes at the start and had to be re&#45;started. 3rd boat boys started a length over the line.
Thank you for the racing ST. Mark&#39;s!
Another great day of racing on the mighty Nashua!
Groton wins the Cooke Family Cup by winning 7 of the 8 races.
