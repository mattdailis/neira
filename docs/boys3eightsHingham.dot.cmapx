Distance: Approx 1450 meters Conditions: Racing conditions were calm for the first half of the course and all boats dealt with a significant crosswind the last half of all races. Comments: Thanks to Hingham for making the trip to St. John’s. Great day of racing with colds temps and a strong crosswind. Good start to the year for both crews!
