Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.

Distance: 1650 Conditions: Strong following current.Variable 15&#45;20mph cross tailwind gusting to 30mph. Comments: Times should not be compared given the strong current and floating start. In the boys&#39; third boat, times were not taken but margins were recorded &#45; the margin is recorded as time from the winning crew.
Andover wins the Perry and Brown Trophy (Boys&#39; 1st boat) and Kent wins the Hart Perry Cup (Girls&#39; 1st boat).
Thank you to Kent for making the long drive and a great day of racing.
