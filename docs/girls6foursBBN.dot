Distance: 1350 M Conditions: Good conditions all day, even across lanes Comments: Good racing by all, in the 1V Nobles drifted in to the BB&N lane in the last 100 meters, then cut back out, finish order was not impacted but margin was.
Girls 7th, 8th and 9th for BB&N and Nobles raced in the JV course, Great to see everyone out there.
