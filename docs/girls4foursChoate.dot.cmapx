Distance: 1400 m (upriver) Conditions: light current, moderate headwind that lessened for the later races Comments: Race order: B4/G4/B3/G3/B2/G2/B1/G1/B5/G5/G8s/G6/B8s;
Notes: the third and fourth boat races had stronger headwinds and were disrupted by jet ski wakes; later races had lighter winds and fewer wakes so times should not be compared between races.

Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.
