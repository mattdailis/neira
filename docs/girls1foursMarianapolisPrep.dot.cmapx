Distance: 1500m Conditions: No current. Slight crossing tailwind to begin (ESE ~6 to 8 MPH) that increased in speed and became more of a solid (S ~10&#45;12 MPH) tail by the last race. Comments: Order of races: G1, G2. There were some boys races between the races. Pomfret&#39;s 3rd boat raced in the 2nd boat category. Marianapolis&#39;s second boat caught a boat stopping crab just after the 250m mark.
