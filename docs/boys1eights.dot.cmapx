Distance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Light wind changing throughout the day, starting as a tailwind, then a cross&#45;wind and finishing the day as headwind. Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare times. In the B1 race Tabor caught a boat stopping crab at 300 meters down. In the B4, St. John&#39;s B had 2 boat stopping crabs. Also in the B4, Stonington B3 raced in this event due to illness. A special thank you to St. John&#39;s an Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.

Distance: Approx 1450 meters Conditions: Racing conditions were calm for the first half of the course and all boats dealt with a significant crosswind the last half of all races. Comments: Thanks to Hingham for making the trip to St. John’s. Great day of racing with colds temps and a strong crosswind. Good start to the year for both crews!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10 mph cross&#45;tail for the 2V and 1V races, considerably less for the 3V race. Comments: Order was 2V, 1V, 3V. 
In the 1V race, Andover steered into Deerfield at the 500m mark when they were level with each other. Both crews lost a stroke or two but recovered well. The coaches did not believe it affected the outcome of the race.
Despite the aligning difficulties and the collision, it was an exciting and productive first race of the season. It was great to see everyone again&#45;&#45;thanks to Andover and Deerfield for making the trip.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Incoming tide and variable cross headwind 8&#45;10 mph. Times cannot be compared between races. In the 3rd/4th boat race, Fairfield&#39;s 4th impeded and clashed oars with Stonington approximately 300 meters after the start. All crews were stopped and the race was re&#45;started from that point. Comments: Really good racing across the board between all crews to start the season. Thanks to Stonington for making the trip.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Flat water conditions, outgoing tide, cross tail wind 5&#45;7 mph. Comments: Time cannot be compared between races as the tide made starting at the line each time challenging, so while they were even bows, the line varied.
Race order was 3rd, 1st, 2nd then 4th. In the 4th boat race crews clashed and had to stop after the start, the race was restarted from that point. St. John&#39;s caught a boat stopping crab less than 300 meters from the finish, they recovered and completed the race.
Thanks to St. John&#39;s Prep for the long trip to Black Rock.
