Distance: 1650m Conditions: Following current, 10&#45;15mph headwind. Comments: Order of racing: G2, B3, G1, B2, B1, G3, B4, G4. Times should not be compared as crews were started with a floating start and conditions built throughout the afternoon.
In the B4 race, Andover and St. John&#39;s Prep combined rowers to make an entry.
Thank you to Duxbury, Deerfield, and St. John&#39;s Prep for making the drive. Great day of racing for all crews.
