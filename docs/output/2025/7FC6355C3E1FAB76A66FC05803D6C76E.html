Distance: 1500m Conditions: Conditions were a moderate and gusting cross-headwind and varying chop. Temperatures were  in the Comments: Both the 1st and 2nd boat races started just over the line.  The 3rd boat race started at about 1350m due to crossing headwind making aligning a bit challenging.  All the crews handled the conditions well and raced with intent.

Thank you to Tabor crews and coaches for traveling to Concord and for the racing.
