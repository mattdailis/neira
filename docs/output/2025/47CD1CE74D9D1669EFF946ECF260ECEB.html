Distance: 1500m Conditions: Slight tailwind and slight tail current. Fairly flat water. Comments: In the 3v race, Fairfield Prep 4v was ahead until around 400m. FP 3v went into the 4v lane and blades collided, which caused FP 4v to get stuck between bridge abutments for a bit. The FP 4v did an excellent job of getting back into racing and made up some ground on the other boats. 

Thank you so much to Fairfield Prep for making the trip to Stonington and starting off the race season with us!
