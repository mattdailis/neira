Distance: 1500m Conditions: Relatively cold, wet weather, but fairly light wind and good water. WIth three crews, some of the floating starts were a little over the line. Comments: Despite the cold rain, conditions were pretty good. The crews were able to line up and get into their races effectively. In the boys' 3rd eight, Deerfield and St. Paul's rowed to a dead heat. They were too close to call at the finish.
Thank you to the Exeter and Deerfield athletes and coaches for a great day of racing.
St. Paul's retains the Davis Cup - given to the winner of the majority of the girls' and boys' races (boats 1 - 4) by virtue of the tie-breaker (in the even years the winner of the girls' first eight).
