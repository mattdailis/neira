Distance: 1500m Conditions: Great conditions on Lake Q &#45; 8&#45;10mph crosswind at beginning of races, tapering to 6&#45;8mph by end of the racing. Very nice water. Comments: Races were started within 10m of the line (before or after), except for G1 which was over a boat length over the line. Thank you to all the visiting coaches who helped on the water today with timing and marshaling. The rain held off and we had a great afternoon of racing.

Distance: Berwick Conditions: Strong head wind gusts in the first 700 meters of the race creating some chop, but generally clean conditions for early April racing. Slightly increasing wind as races progressed. Comments: Race order was Girls 1V, Boys 2V, Girls 2V*,Boys 3V, &amp; Boys 1V**
*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line&#45;ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.
**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.
