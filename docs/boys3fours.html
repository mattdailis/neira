Distance: Berwick Conditions: Strong head wind gusts in the first 700 meters of the race creating some chop, but generally clean conditions for early April racing. Slightly increasing wind as races progressed. Comments: Race order was Girls 1V, Boys 2V, Girls 2V*,Boys 3V, &amp; Boys 1V**
*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line-ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.
**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.

Comments: Thank you to Andover for coming to Kent today for a great day of racing. Kudos go to all athletes for being flexible in the schedule as the threat of bad weather approached.

Thanks to a flexible, enthusiastic and impressive Nobles squad for making the trip up to Brooks. Good, clean racing across the board. Note that B4 and B5 were both started with their sterns on the starting line. 
Good luck Nobles on your season.
