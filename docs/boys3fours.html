Distance: Berwick Conditions: Strong head wind gusts in the first 700 meters of the race creating some chop, but generally clean conditions for early April racing. Slightly increasing wind as races progressed. Comments: Race order was Girls 1V, Boys 2V, Girls 2V*,Boys 3V, &amp; Boys 1V**
*Please note that the Girls 2V should be considered an exhibition as there were Varsity rowers to fill out the line-ups to give younger rowers the chance to race.
**Berwick suffered breakage before the race (which could not be mended on the water), so they raced without steering.

Comments: Thank you to Andover for coming to Kent today for a great day of racing. Kudos go to all athletes for being flexible in the schedule as the threat of bad weather approached. You should not compare times between different races, as each race started at a slightly different point due to the winds.

Lyme/Old Lyme B3 and G4, Hopkins G3 and G4 boats were novices. Wet launch at 56F water stirred excitement! Challenging conditions caused Hopkins B3 and G3 boats, LOL G2, G3, and G4 to miss the turn buoys and row a shorter course. Thank you, LOL and NMH for coming to our home river.
