Distance: 1650m Conditions: Strong following current. 10&#45;15mph quartering headwind. Comments: Floating start and strong current &#45; not all crews started exactly on the line. The G4 race started approximately 300m downriver of the start. In the Boys&#39; 5th boat, SPS caught a boat&#45;stopping crab.
Thank you to St. Paul&#39;s and Hingham for making the trip. Great day of racing for all crews.
