Distance: 1275m Conditions: All races were against an incoming tide. Stong crosswind created significant chop, especially in the final 500m. Comments: Thank you to Deerfield for rescheduling and making the trip.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Conditions were difficult. Cross tail wind steady at 15 mph, gusting to 25&#45;30 at times. Outgoing tide. Mid course white caps, the later portion of the course was nearly flat conditions. Comments: Race order was 3,2,1,4. Conditions dictated a shortened course for the 4th boats, they raced 1K. Starting line for all races was approximate, crews were level but times cannot be compared between races at all.
A challenging day, thank you to Brunswick and Coach Martin for persevering and taking on the conditions. Brunswick retains the Kulaga Cup by winning the 3rd and 1st boat races.
