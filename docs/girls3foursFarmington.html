Distance: 1500m Conditions: Conditions varied a lot during the races. Mostly a head crosswind, sometimes gusting over 15mph Comments: Great day of racing. The wind changed quite a bit during the day, but it was fair racing in windy conditions. Thank you to all the teams that raced today!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Strong cross wind throughout racing , slight headwind. Tide incoming against course for boys 1v, none for girls 1v and outgoing with course rest of races. Not comparable times across races. Comments: Novice races were 1000m. In the girls 2v race, a Farmington rowerâ€™s oar came out of the oarlock in the last 250m of the race. In the boys novice, East Lyme caught a crab off the start. Stonington and East Lyme raced an exhibition 4+ event. 
Thank you so much to East Lyme and Farmington for making the trip to Mystic!
