Choate -> Hopkins[label="65.19 (73.52)
04/12", weight="35", tooltip="NEIRA Boys & Girls Fours,Choate vs. Hopkins			
Distance: 1330m Conditions: Gusty headwind. Water remained relatively calm, but strong bursts of wind caused boats to struggle with blade control at times leading to several crabs across most races. Comments: B1 race resulted in a dead tie. We could not resolve the result even with video. Again, most races affected by strong gusts of wind.
