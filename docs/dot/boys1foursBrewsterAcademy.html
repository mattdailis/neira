Distance: 1500 Conditions: Variable headwind, started out light for G4 and B4 races and gradually built up to a steady headwind, especially at the last 500m. Gusts up to 15mph at moments. Comments: Races were all started on the line and it was a great day on the Lake. Thanks to all the crews who came out to race!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Tail Current with a strong tail/cross wind with occasional gusts. Fun conditions for first race of the season! Thank you for Brewster for making the trip.
