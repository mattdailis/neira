Distance: 1500 Conditions: Tail Current with a strong tail/cross wind with occasional gusts. Fun conditions for first race of the season! Thank you for Brewster for making the trip. Comments: Mixed boats were exhibition events and a combo of boys and girls of various skill levels - anything to get some new rowers more racing experience!
