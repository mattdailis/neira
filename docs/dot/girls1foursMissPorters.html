Distance: 1500m Conditions: ~9MPH crossing headwind from lane 6 to lane 1, with occasional gusts. Beginning of race slightly choppier than finish. Conditions seemed to improve marginally by last race (G1). Comments: Alternated races with boys races. Order of girls races: G-Novice, G4, G3, G5, G2, G1. The novice boat race is listed in the sixth boat category. Crossing wind pushed almost all boats at least one lane to port. Several referee calls for boats to move to starboard in the lower boat races. Congratulations to Taft G1 for winning the 2024 du Pont Cup.
