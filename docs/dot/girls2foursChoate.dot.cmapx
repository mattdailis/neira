Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Flat water; light, variable headwind in first 1000 meters, then calm. Comments: B3: Taft left their lane, interfered with Berkshire, then corrected, but then crossed Choate&#39;s lane in the last 250 M. Did not change placement, but Berkshire&#39;s margin over Choate might have been larger without the interference.
Thanks to Taft and Choate for some great racing in ideal conditions.
