Distance: 1650 Conditions: Strong following current.Variable 15-20mph cross tailwind gusting to 30mph. Comments: Times should not be compared given the strong current and floating start. In the boys' third boat, times were not taken but margins were recorded - the margin is recorded as time from the winning crew.
Andover wins the Perry and Brown Trophy (Boys' 1st boat) and Kent wins the Hart Perry Cup (Girls' 1st boat).
Thank you to Kent for making the long drive and a great day of racing.
