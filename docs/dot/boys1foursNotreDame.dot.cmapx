Distance: 1500 Conditions: Gusty head wind with an incoming tide, racing was against the river current.
Slight chop in areas on the race course but for the most part flat water. Comments: Close racing across all events.
In the 1V race King and Notre Dame were even with 350 meters to go when ND 1V caught a boat stopping crab.
The King 4V raced in the 3V event.
