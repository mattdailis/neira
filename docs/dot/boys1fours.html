Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12-14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short-lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3-G4-B2-G1-B1-G2-G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren't comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Variable headwind. Strongest during the Girls and Boys 2nd boat races. Water was mostly flat in the middle third of the course, with more chop in the first and last 500m. Again strongest during the 2nd boat races. Comments: Good job by the coxswains and the aligner working with some tricky wind at the starting line. Race order G4-B4-G3-B3-G2-B2-G1-B1. Finish order in the G3 race confirmed by camera at the finish line. Well rowed by all crews. Thank you CRLS for joining us for a great afternoon of racing!

Groton G1 victory by a matter of inches, and the B3 race declared a dead heat for second place with less than an inch of separation. Thank you to all the coaches and teams for making the trip to Brooks and for your cooperation and spirited competition.

Lyme/Old Lyme would like thank Middletown and Mills for coming out to race on our lake. We are always excited to have teams come and visit and enjoy our facility with us.
Thank you for a great day of racing and we look forward to seeing you all again soon!!

The girls novice/novice mix will be recorded as GV2 (please note the novice mix boat (Eagle Hill) was a mix of talent and more of a friendly race to get rowers to race). Due to wind Boys Novice started at the 1400 mark.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: At the start, crossing tailwinds of ~10MPH. Winds shifted to a mostly tail after first 500M of ~15MPH, with occasional gusts 20 to 25. Water was choppy after the first 500M all the way to finish line. Comments: Race order: B4, B3, B5, B2, B1 (with girls' races interspersed).
Winds made aligning starts challenging. Commendable job by aligner. B2 crews were roughly 30ft. over the line at the start. Course steering was challenging for almost all crews. Wind also affected crews as many drifted into other lanes, though no significant impediments that impacted finish order were detected.

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Flat water; light, variable headwind in first 1000 meters, then calm. Comments: B3: Taft left their lane, interfered with Berkshire, then corrected, but then crossed Choate's lane in the last 250 M. Did not change placement, but Berkshire's margin over Choate might have been larger without the interference.
Thanks to Taft and Choate for some great racing in ideal conditions.

Distance: 1500 Conditions: ~9MPH crossing headwind from lane 6 to lane 1, with occasional gusts. Beginning of race slightly choppier than finish. Conditions seemed to improve marginally by last race (B1). Comments: Alternated races with girls races. Order of boys races: B5, B6, B4, B3, B2, B1.
St. Mark's 5 missed B5 race start time and raced in B6 race.
Gunn was a scratch in the B1 race.
Pomfret B3 caught two minor crabs early in its race.
Crossing wind pushed almost all boats at least one lane to port. Many referee calls for boats to move to starboard.
Congratulations to Taft B1 for winning the 2024 du Pont Cup.

Distance: 1300 Conditions: Good water with swirling winds -- sometimes cross-head, sometimes cross-tail, sometimes straight cross, varying race-to-race. Comments: The 3V4 race was action-packed: MX caught an over-the-head, boat-stopping crab just over a minute into the race, while the 3-seat of the BHS crew had his oar pop out of his oarlock not once but twice during the race; these incidents caused stoppages of significant duration for both crews. An oarsman in the CRLS 1V4 tested positive for Covid prior to the race and the crew was thus unable to compete today.
Thanks to Middlesex and CRLS for a great day of racing on the Charles!

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Direct gusty headwind that generally diminished from 12-15 mph in the early races to 6-8 mph over the course of the afternoon, but varied such that comparisons between races would not be meaningful. Race order G5-B1-G4-B4-G3-B3-G2-B2-G1 Comments: Fantastic afternoon of racing with two races relying on the finish line camera. Groton G1 victory by a matter of inches, and the B3 race declared a dead heat for second place with less than an inch of separation. Thank you to all the coaches and teams for making the trip to Brooks and for your cooperation and spirited competition.
Choate did not race a B3 and NCDS did not race a G4 today.

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Overcast, 60 deg., calm for first 500, then very light (5 mph) and variable tail wind for latter 1000 M. Flat water throughout. Comments: Order of racing: G1, G2, B2, B1, G3, B4, B3, G4/nov. Berkshire doubled a rower from G2 to G4 (all-novice boat); Hopkins and Lyme doubled rowers from G3 to G4. B1: Berkshire and LOL encroached on Hopkins' lane approaching the finish, but Hopkins was judged to be too far back to have been impeded. G4: Lyme and Hopkins clashed oars briefly 300 meters from the finish, then separated. Lyme stopped a couple of strokes short of the line. Thanks to visiting teams for traveling, and to the coxswains for their generally excellent work.

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Overcast, 60 deg., calm for first 500, then very light (5 mph) and variable tail wind for latter 1000 M. Flat water throughout. Comments: Order of racing: G1, G2, B2, B1, G3, B4, B3, G4/nov. Berkshire doubled a rower from G2 to G4 (all-novice boat); Hopkins and Lyme doubled rowers from G3 to G4. B1: Berkshire and LOL encroached on Hopkins' lane approaching the finish, but Hopkins was judged to be too far back to have been impeded. G4: Lyme and Hopkins clashed oars briefly 300 meters from the finish, then separated. Lyme stopped a couple of strokes short of the line. Thanks to visiting teams for traveling, and to the coxswains for their generally excellent work.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Direct gusty headwind that generally diminished from 12-15 mph in the early races to 6-8 mph over the course of the afternoon, but varied such that comparisons between races would not be meaningful.

Groton G1 victory by a matter of inches, and the B3 race declared a dead heat for second place with less than an inch of separation. Thank you to all the coaches and teams for making the trip to Brooks and for your cooperation and spirited competition.
Choate did not race a B3 and NCDS did not race a G4 today.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Direct gusty headwind that generally diminished from 12-15 mph in the early races to 6-8 mph over the course of the afternoon, but varied such that comparisons between races would not be meaningful. Race order G5-B1-G4-B4-G3-B3-G2-B2-G1 Comments: Fantastic afternoon of racing with two races relying on the finish line camera. Groton G1 victory by a matter of inches, and the B3 race declared a dead heat for second place with less than an inch of separation. Thank you to all the coaches and teams for making the trip to Brooks and for your cooperation and spirited competition.
Choate did not race a B3 and NCDS did not race a G4 today.

Distance: 1400m (upriver) Conditions: Beautiful conditions, with light chop and moderate current building slightly through the afternoon. All races started from the same position, but conditions seemed a bit faster for the lower boats compared with the first boat races. Comments: Thank you to Nobles and Deerfield athletes and coaches for some great racing today on the beautiful Connecticut River.

Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15-25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.

Distance: 1350m Conditions: Excellent conditions.
Cloudy and cool
Mostly flat water.
A very light headwind for later races. Comments: In boys 4th boat race, Groton and BB&amp;N clashed blades for roughly the first 20 strokes due to Groton moving into BB&amp;N's lane off the start. This did not affect the order of finish but did have an effect on margins. Both boats handled the situation well once within it.
5th boats raced on the Powerhouse course approximately 2 hours earlier than Varsity racing.
NOTE: 6th, 7th boat races took place on the Charles River JV course, from Northeastern to the Kayak Pavilion.
BB&amp;N and Nobles also raced their 7th and 8th boat crews in eights, a race which was slightly shorter due to a restart.
Times for this race were:
Nobles: 2:22.3
BB&amp;N: 2:30.1
many thanks to all crews and coaches for a great day of racing for full teams.
