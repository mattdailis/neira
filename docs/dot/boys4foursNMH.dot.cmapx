Distance: 1400m (upriver) Conditions: Beautiful conditions, with light chop and moderate current building slightly through the afternoon. All races started from the same position, but conditions seemed a bit faster for the lower boats compared with the first boat races. Comments: Thank you to Nobles and Deerfield athletes and coaches for some great racing today on the beautiful Connecticut River.
