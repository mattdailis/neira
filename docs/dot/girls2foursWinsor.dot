Winsor -> BBN[label="4.4 (5.08)
04/27", weight="96", tooltip="NEIRA,The Winsor School vs. BB&N			
Distance: 1300 Conditions: Flat and equal conditions across all races. Steering in 3V race resulted in both crews finishing off the course with an indistinguishable margin (deemed a tie). 4V crews reversed lanes mid-race, potentially impacting margin but not finish order. 5th and 6th boats were composite to provide a race for all athletes. Thank you to BB&N for a fun race!
