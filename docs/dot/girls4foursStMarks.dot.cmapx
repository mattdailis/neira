Distance: 1500m Conditions: A prevailing 12&#45;14mph crosswind shifting to a cross/tail for some races. Two small short&#45;lived squalls came through with wind gusts over 30mph. Other times, gusts were up to 24mph. Conditions gradually improved over the course of the races. Comments: Race order was B3&#45;G4&#45;B2&#45;G1&#45;B1&#45;G2&#45;G3. There was no B4 race. Races aren&#39;t comparable because of very shifty conditions. Boys 2V started 50m over the line.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Partly cloudy, with variable winds switching from cross&#45;wind to cross&#45;tail 8&#45;12mph. Quite calm for 4th boat races, picked up during 1V and 2V races. Comments: Times for G3 weren&#39;t started until about 650m in, so we got margins only.
