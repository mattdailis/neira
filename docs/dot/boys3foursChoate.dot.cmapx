Distance: 1500m Conditions: Stiff crosswind in the first 500m, settling into a light tailwind for the last 1k. Mostly consistent wind with some gusts toward the end of day. Comments: Due to hotseating, order of races ran: B3, G2, G4, B2, B1, G1, B4, G3, GN. Choate G1 was a scratch.

Distance: 1500 M Conditions: Flat water; light, variable headwind in first 1000 meters, then calm. Comments: B3: Taft left their lane, interfered with Berkshire, then corrected, but then crossed Choate&#39;s lane in the last 250 M. Did not change placement, but Berkshire&#39;s margin over Choate might have been larger without the interference.
Thanks to Taft and Choate for some great racing in ideal conditions.
