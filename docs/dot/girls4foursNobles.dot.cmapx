Distance: ~1500m Conditions: Gusty headwind (15&#45;25 mph) in moderate chop along lee shore. Crews had approximately the same conditions. Lane assignments probably affected times somewhat. Comments: Challenging conditions overcome by the constructive attitudes of all the coaches and race enthusiasm of athletes. Thanks to a strong Nobles team for coming up for some raw weather racing in early April. We were pleased to get the races in.

Distance: 1400m (upriver) Conditions: Beautiful conditions, with light chop and moderate current building slightly through the afternoon. All races started from the same position, but conditions seemed a bit faster for the lower boats compared with the first boat races. Comments: Thank you to Nobles and Deerfield athletes and coaches for some great racing today on the beautiful Connecticut River.
