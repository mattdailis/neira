Distance: 1500 Conditions: Light drizzle and grey skies, but flat conditions. Racing in the direction of the incoming tide. Comments: The boys 4V even was a combination of 4V boys with novice boys and served as an intersquad scrimmage. This race was slightly shorter and started around the 1250 mark.
The girls 3V was a mixed boat event with even gender splits in each boat and represented various skill levels.
Thank you Derryfield for making the trip and dealing with Maine mud season.
