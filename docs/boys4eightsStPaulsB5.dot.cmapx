Distance: 1500 meters Conditions: Quartering tailwind at the start of the afternoon lessened through the racing. Comments: Race order: B3&#45;B2&#45;B1&#45;B4/5.
B3 started one seat over the line. In the B4/B5 race, Tabor caught a significant but not boat&#45;stopping crab in the first 250m.
Thanks to Tabor for making the trip up north to SPS.
