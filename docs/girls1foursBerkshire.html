Distance: 1500m Conditions: No current. Slight crossing tailwind to begin (ESE ~6 to 8 MPH) that increased in speed and became more of a solid (S ~10-12 MPH) tail by the last race. Comments: Order of races: G1, G2. There were some boys races between the races. Pomfret's 3rd boat raced in the 2nd boat category. Marianapolis's second boat caught a boat stopping crab just after the 250m mark.

Distance: 1490 M Conditions: Overcast, mid-50s. Variable, gusty wind; crosswind to quartering tail, 10-12 mph; mostly affecting latter half of the course. Comments: Great to have all three programs racing together again for the first time since 2019. Thanks to Choate and Taft for traveling and handling facilities issues.
