Distance: 1,150 Conditions: Moderate head current and moderate head wind with gusts. Conditions remained the same for all racing. Comments: Thank you E.O. Smith for a fun day of racing! Novice events were combined, and E.O. Smith raced a mixed boat. Not for seeding. 3V boats from Farmington raced together. Great racing from all crews.
