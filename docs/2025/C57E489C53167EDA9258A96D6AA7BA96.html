Distance: 1700m Conditions: 14mph quartering head wind in a moderate tail current. The wind was the worst for the B4 and the B2 races. Comments: It was a great day of racing. Do not compare times between races, as some started further down the course than others. It was a great day of celebration as Kent dedicated a new shell and introduced the Michael W. Lehman '89 Trophy as a cup race between the first boats of Kent School and BC High.
