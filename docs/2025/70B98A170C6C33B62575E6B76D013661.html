Distance: 1,500m Conditions: Calm conditions for all races. Fully buoyed course. No wind and light patches of rain. Comments: N.B. REVISED TIMES Correcting error in previously posted Boys 1st Boat Times.

All races were held in near ideal conditions with flat water and no wind. Intermittent light rain fell during most races and temperatures stayed in the 40's. 

The one race of any incident was the G3V 8+. After a boat-stopping crab about 100 m after the start, Shrewsbury were left approximately 3-4 lengths in the wake of the Bedford girls. 

Shrewsbury doggedly regathered & threw everything they had at chasing down Bedford - who by this stage held, what looked to be, insurmountable lead. Slowly but surely Shrewsbury regained contact and in a final burst, just 5 strokes before the finish line, edged their bow in front, by approximately 12 inches. 

The finish was recorded by the finish tower officials and reviewed before awarding the race to Shrewsbury.
