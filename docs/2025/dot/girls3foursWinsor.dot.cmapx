Distance: 1300 Conditions: Great day of racing. Crossing tailwind with a few gusts, but nothing to impede racing or steering. 5th, 6th, 7th boats raced a shortened course due to current and timing restraints. Thank you to Choate for making the trip to Boston and CRLS for a great afternoon of racing!
Race order: 3V,4V,1V,2V,5V,6V,7V Comments: CRLS and Choate also raced a 7V, resulting&#45;&#45;CRLS: 5:15.71 Choate: 5:52.01.

Distance: 1350 M Conditions: Rain, heavy at times, consistant head wind, sloppy conditions in the last 300M Comments: In the 6V race BB&amp;N Boat A&#39;s oar popped out of the oar lock multi times, forcing Winsor to alter course close to a bridge.
In the 1 V race Winsor left thier lane, and into BB&amp;Ns lane in the last 250.
Thanks to Winsor and GA for the racing and GA making the trip to Boston.
