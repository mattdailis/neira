Distance: 1500 Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed. Comments: Alternated races with girls' teams. Order of boys races: B4, B5, B6, B3, B2, B1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as raced progressed.) Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn's boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay). That delay and delays in aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning, for boys, with B3 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience. Congratulations to Pomfret Boys and Winsor Girls for winning the 2025 du Pont Cup.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10-13mph crossing headwind from SSW. Occasional gusts of 20mph in the first half hour of racing. Race order was 4-3-2-1. Comments: D/S 1V caught an over the head crab at 300m to go and had to reset. D/S 2V had steering issue and DNF.
Thank you to all crews who came out to race on Lake Q!
