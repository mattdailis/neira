Building direct headwind for the first three races, strongest for the 2V4; the wind then lessened and shifted to a cross/cross headwind for the 1V4 and remaining races Comments: Thanks to Nobles for being patient and supportive through yesterday's weather-related postponement and for a great day of racing with our full programs today!
