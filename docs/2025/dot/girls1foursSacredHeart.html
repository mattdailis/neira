Distance: 1400m Conditions: Race order: 2V, 3V, 1V.
2V race rowed into approximately 12 mph cross headwind. Due to the wind, alignment took a little longer, and pushed the race to about 1420m.
3V saw an increase in winds and a pronounced shift to a truer crosswind in the last 400m.
1V had the balmiest conditions, with a weaker cross head.
Water for all races was relatively flat, with the 1V seeing the best water. All racing was against the tide. Comments: GA and SH fielded three varsity boats; GCDS fielded a 1V and 2V and entered a novice boys boat into the 3V as an exhibition event.
Thanks to SH and GCDS for coming out to race.
