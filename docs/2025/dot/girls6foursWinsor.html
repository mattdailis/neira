Distance: 1350 M Conditions: Rain, heavy at times, consistant head wind, sloppy conditions in the last 300M Comments: In the 6V race BB&amp;N Boat A's oar popped out of the oar lock multi times, forcing Winsor to alter course close to a bridge.
In the 1 V race Winsor left thier lane, and into BB&amp;Ns lane in the last 250.
Thanks to Winsor and GA for the racing and GA making the trip to Boston.
