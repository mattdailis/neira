Distance: 1400 Conditions: Gusty winds for the first 1k-1.1k, cross head coming from NW. Wind gusts up to 32 MPH. Wind increased tremendously throughout racing, 3V race saw the worst of it. Comments: Newton had a 4V so they raced in the 3V category as well. Although wind was not great, everyone had a safe and good race. Thank you Newton for coming!

In G4 race a NCDS boat waring up cause BBN to swerve, it did not effect results, may have effected the margin.. In the G1 race MX coxswain got dizzy and verred off course, but corrected and stay in her bouyed lane it did not effect results,may have effected the margin. Comments: Thanks BBN &amp; NCDS for coming and egtting races in before the storm!!
