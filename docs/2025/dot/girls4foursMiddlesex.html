Comments: Thanks BBN &amp; NCDS for coming and egtting races in before the storm!!

Thanks to all crews for taking a risk on the weather and making the trip to Brooks for a good afternoon of racing. Thanks for the great cooperation of all crews and especially the coxswains in a 5-lane floating start.
