Distance: 1500m Conditions: Direct 10-15 mph tailwind increasing to 20 mph throughout the afternoon. Significant chop in the last 1000m. Race order was 5-4-3-2-1 Comments: The girls 2nd boat event was run as planned between Brooks, Choate and Groton. Following the day of racing, after a complaint was lodged, the coaches and race officials reached consensus that a clash of blades between Choate and Groton in the first 20 strokes of the race should in retrospect have warranted a re-start of the race, and therefore the race results are deemed invalid for purposes of seeding and comparison. Accordingly, no results have been posted for this race. 
Thank you to all coaches and teams for braving some choppy seas and racing well today.

Distance: 1300m Conditions: Order of racing: 4V4-3V4-2V4-1V4-4V8-6V4-9V4-5V4. Building direct headwind for the first three races, strongest for the 2V4; the wind then lessened and shifted to a cross/cross headwind for the 1V4 and remaining races Comments: Thanks to Nobles for being patient and supportive through yesterday's weather-related postponement and for a great day of racing with our full programs today!

Distance: 1,500m Conditions: Race order was B4, B3, B2, B1 and conditions were fairly consistent across all races: a moderate crossing head wind at the start that evolved into a sporadic light cross head wind at points throughout the course. A good day for racing all around.
