Distance: 1300m Conditions: Order of racing: 4V4-3V4-2V4-1V4-4V8-6V4-9V4-5V4. Building direct headwind for the first three races, strongest for the 2V4; the wind then lessened and shifted to a cross/cross headwind for the 1V4 and remaining races Comments: Thanks to Nobles for being patient and supportive through yesterday's weather-related postponement and for a great day of racing with our full programs today!
