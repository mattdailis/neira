Distance: 1500 Conditions: Occasional rain and 10&#45;12 mph cross headwind for first 1000 meters with choppy waters; wind and chop diminished in last 500. Conditions improved somewhat for the later races. Race order 5&#45;1&#45;2&#45;3&#45;4 Comments: Girls second boat event was a dead heat for 1st &#45; even the finish line camera was inconclusive. Thanks to all crews for taking a risk on the weather and making the trip to Brooks for a good afternoon of racing. Thanks for the great cooperation of all crews and especially the coxswains in a 5&#45;lane floating start.
