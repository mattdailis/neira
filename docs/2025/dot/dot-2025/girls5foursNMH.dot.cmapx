Distance: 1500m Conditions: Consistent crossing tailwind (~7&#45;13MPH), with occasional stronger gusts. Light chop after the first 500M. Hopkins&#39; oar popped out of the oarlock in the 3rd boat race in the last 200m and they had to stop to reset for a few seconds. Comments: Tailwinds increased somewhat during the course of racing. Order of girls races: G1, G4, G3, G2, G5. (There was an hour and fifteen minutes between the G2 and G5 race. 15 minutes between the other four races.)
