Building direct headwind for the first three races, strongest for the 2V4; the wind then lessened and shifted to a cross/cross headwind for the 1V4 and remaining races Comments: Thanks to Nobles for being patient and supportive through yesterday's weather-related postponement and for a great day of racing with our full programs today!

Distance: 1,500m Conditions: Race order was B4, B3, B2, B1 and conditions were fairly consistent across all races: a moderate crossing head wind at the start that evolved into a sporadic light cross head wind at points throughout the course. A good day for racing all around.
