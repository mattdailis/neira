Conditions improved somewhat for the later races. Race order 5-1-2-3-4 Comments: Girls second boat event was a dead heat for 1st - even the finish line camera was inconclusive. Thanks to all crews for taking a risk on the weather and making the trip to Brooks for a good afternoon of racing. Thanks for the great cooperation of all crews and especially the coxswains in a 5-lane floating start.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Gusting tailwind and chop. and sometimes cross tail throughout. Reverse Order, Some crews started over the line. In G4 race a NCDS boat waring up cause BBN to swerve, it did not effect results, may have effected the margin.. In the G1 race MX coxswain got dizzy and verred off course, but corrected and stay in her bouyed lane it did not effect results,may have effected the margin. Comments: Thanks BBN &amp; NCDS for coming and egtting races in before the storm!!
