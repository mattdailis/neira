Distance: 1500 Conditions: Occasional rain and 10-12 mph cross headwind for first 1000 meters with choppy waters; wind and chop diminished in last 500. Conditions improved somewhat for the later races. Race order 5-1-2-3-4 Comments: Girls second boat event was a dead heat for 1st - even the finish line camera was inconclusive. Thanks to all crews for taking a risk on the weather and making the trip to Brooks for a good afternoon of racing. Thanks for the great cooperation of all crews and especially the coxswains in a 5-lane floating start.
