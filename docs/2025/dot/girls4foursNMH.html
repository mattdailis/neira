Distance: 1500m Conditions: Consistent crossing tailwind (~7-13MPH), with occasional stronger gusts. Light chop after the first 500M. Hopkins' oar popped out of the oarlock in the 3rd boat race in the last 200m and they had to stop to reset for a few seconds. Comments: Tailwinds increased somewhat during the course of racing. Order of girls races: G1, G4, G3, G2, G5. (There was an hour and fifteen minutes between the G2 and G5 race. 15 minutes between the other four races.)
