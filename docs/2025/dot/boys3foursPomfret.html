Distance: 1500 Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed. Comments: Alternated races with girls' teams. Order of boys races: B4, B5, B6, B3, B2, B1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as raced progressed.) Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn's boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay).
