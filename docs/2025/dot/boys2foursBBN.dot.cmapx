Distance: 1350 Conditions: Strong headwind (~20 mph) with occasional whitecaps throughout racing, getting stronger towards the finish line. The wind seemed to lighten up a little at the start of the 1st boat race. Order of racing was 4, 3, 2, 1. Comments: The wind made it challenging for all coxswains to maintain good courses. In the last 300 meters of the 3rd boat race, both teams veered off course a bit such that they ended up in each other&#39;s lane. It did not impact margin or finish order. 
In the last 200 meters of the 1st boat race, both coxswains steered slightly towards each other, causing them to get very close to oars clashing a couple of times but never made contact with each other. Puddles overlapped for about 5 strokes. This did not alter order of finish but may have impacted the margin. Thanks to Middlesex for making the trip and toughing out the wind!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed. Comments: Alternated races with girls&#39; teams. Order of boys races: B4, B5, B6, B3, B2, B1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as raced progressed.) Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn&#39;s boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay).

Distance: 1350 Conditions: Slight cross tailwind getting stronger throughout the afternoon. Order of races 4, 3, 2, 1. Thanks to Thayer for making the trip! Comments: During the last 250m of the 3rd boat race, the Charles River Cruise Ship was coming upstream causing both coxswains to divert their course slightly to starboard. The coxswains handled it quite well, and it did not impact order of finish. 
During the last 300m of the 1st boat race, CRLS veered strongly to starboard cutting across into BB&amp;N&#39;s lane and causing BB&amp;N to alter their course slightly and steer to avoid a collision. CRLS continued to move to starboard, ending up about 2&#45;3 lanes over from where they started. It is unclear whether this altered order of finish. Given how close the margin was and the lane violation by CRLS, the coaches mutually decided not to award the Mayor&#39;s Cup (the winner of the 1st boat race) to either team, but to award the Cup later this season to whichever team finishes in a higher seed at the NEIRA regatta.
