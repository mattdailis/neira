Distance: 1500m Conditions: 10&#45;13mph crossing headwind from SSW. Occasional gusts of 20mph in the first half hour of racing. Race order was 4&#45;3&#45;2&#45;1. Comments: D/S 1V caught an over the head crab at 300m to go and had to reset. D/S 2V had steering issue and DNF.
Thank you to all crews who came out to race on Lake Q!

Distance: 1500 Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed. Comments: Alternated races with girls&#39; teams. Order of boys races: B4, B5, B6, B3, B2, B1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as raced progressed.) Gunn raced down with their 1st boat racing in the B2 and their 2nd in B3. In the B2 race, Gunn&#39;s boat flipped in the last 250 meters (all okay). That delay and delays in aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning, for boys, with B3 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience. Congratulations to Pomfret Boys and Winsor Girls for winning the 2025 du Pont Cup.
