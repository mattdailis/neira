Distance: 1300 Conditions: Great day of racing. Crossing tailwind with a few gusts, but nothing to impede racing or steering. 5th, 6th, 7th boats raced a shortened course due to current and timing restraints. Thank you to Choate for making the trip to Boston and CRLS for a great afternoon of racing!
Race order: 3V,4V,1V,2V,5V,6V,7V Comments: CRLS and Choate also raced a 7V, resulting&#45;&#45;CRLS: 5:15.71 Choate: 5:52.01.
