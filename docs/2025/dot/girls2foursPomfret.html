BB&amp;N, Gunn, St. Mark's, Taft, Miss Porter's, Winsor			
Distance: 1500m Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed with the worst conditions in the G2 and then a lull in the wind in the G1. Comments: Alternated races with boys' teams. Order of girls races: G3, G6/Novice, G4, G5, G2, G1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as races progressed.) The delay of a boat flipping in a boys race and delays in restarting races and aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning with G2 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience. 
G6/Novice: This race was restarted due to a collision in the first few strokes between BB&amp;N and Gunn. Porter's repeatedly veered into Pomfret's lane throughout the first 500-750m meters of the race, resulting in repeated maneuvers from Pomfret to keep from being hit. Taft and Winsor collided in the last 300m and took 10-15 seconds to disentangle themselves before beginning to race again.
G5: This race was restarted because St. Mark's and Porter's collided just off the start. In the restarted race, Porter's veered into St. Mark's lane while just ahead of them at the 750m and St. Mark's needed to steer the long way around them. Taft caught an over the head crab at the 1000m and stopped to reset.
G2: Winsor petitioned the results due to a clashing of oars between Winsor and St. Mark's at the start of the race.
Congratulations to Pomfret Boys and Winsor Girls for winning the 2025 du Pont Cup.

Distance: 1500m Conditions: Consistent crossing tailwind (~7-13MPH), with occasional stronger gusts. Light chop after the first 500M. Hopkins' oar popped out of the oarlock in the 3rd boat race in the last 200m and they had to stop to reset for a few seconds. Comments: Tailwinds increased somewhat during the course of racing. Order of girls races: G1, G4, G3, G2, G5. (There was an hour and fifteen minutes between the G2 and G5 race. 15 minutes between the other four races.)

BB&amp;N, Gunn, St. Mark's, Taft, Miss Porter's, Winsor			
Distance: 1500m Conditions: Quarting Headwind ~9 mph, but occasional strong gusts up to 20 mph. Light chop in places, but the water was generally good. Winds increased as races progressed with the worst conditions in the G2 and then a lull in the wind in the G1. Comments: Alternated races with boys' teams. Order of girls races: G3, G6/Novice, G4, G5, G2, G1. (Note: winds/gusts grew stronger as races progressed.) The delay of a boat flipping in a boys race and delays in restarting races and aligning boats in headwind delayed races beginning with G2 as much as ~20 to 30 minutes. Thanks to all for your patience. 
G6/Novice: This race was restarted due to a collision in the first few strokes between BB&amp;N and Gunn. Porter's repeatedly veered into Pomfret's lane throughout the first 500-750m meters of the race, resulting in repeated maneuvers from Pomfret to keep from being hit. Taft and Winsor collided in the last 300m and took 10-15 seconds to disentangle themselves before beginning to race again.
G5: This race was restarted because St. Mark's and Porter's collided just off the start. In the restarted race, Porter's veered into St. Mark's lane while just ahead of them at the 750m and St. Mark's needed to steer the long way around them. Taft caught an over the head crab at the 1000m and stopped to reset.
G2: Winsor petitioned the results due to a clashing of oars between Winsor and St. Mark's at the start of the race.
Congratulations to Pomfret Boys and Winsor Girls for winning the 2025 du Pont Cup.
