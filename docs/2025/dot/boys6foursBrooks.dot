Distance: 1500m Conditions: 8-10 mph direct headwind on the course, remaining fairly consistent throughout the afternoon. Some might chop but generally good conditions - best this spring! Race order 4-3-2-1-5-6 Comments: Photo-finish in the G4 event showed a 3-5 inch gap between Brooks and BB&N. Thanks to all the coaches and athletes for making the beautiful afternoon productive on the water. Good luck to all crews in your remaining races.
