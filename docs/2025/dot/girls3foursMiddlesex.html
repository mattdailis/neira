Thanks to all crews for taking a risk on the weather and making the trip to Brooks for a good afternoon of racing.

In the G1 race MX coxswain got dizzy and verred off course, but corrected and stay in her bouyed lane it did not effect results,may have effected the margin. Comments: Thanks BBN &amp; NCDS for coming and egtting races in before the storm!!
