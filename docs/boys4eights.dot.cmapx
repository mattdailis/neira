B3 started one seat over the line. In the B4/B5 race, Tabor caught a significant but not boat&#45;stopping crab in the first 250m.
Thanks to Tabor for making the trip up north to SPS.

Distance: 1650m Conditions: Following current, 10&#45;15mph headwind. Comments: Order of racing: G2, B3, G1, B2, B1, G3, B4, G4. Times should not be compared as crews were started with a floating start and conditions built throughout the afternoon.
In the B4 race, Andover and St. John&#39;s Prep combined rowers to make an entry.
Thank you to Duxbury, Deerfield, and St. John&#39;s Prep for making the drive. Great day of racing for all crews.

Distance: 1400 Conditions: Flat water conditions, outgoing tide, cross tail wind 5&#45;7 mph. Comments: Time cannot be compared between races as the tide made starting at the line each time challenging, so while they were even bows, the line varied.
Race order was 3rd, 1st, 2nd then 4th. In the 4th boat race crews clashed and had to stop after the start, the race was restarted from that point. St. John&#39;s caught a boat stopping crab less than 300 meters from the finish, they recovered and completed the race.
Thanks to St. John&#39;s Prep for the long trip to Black Rock.
