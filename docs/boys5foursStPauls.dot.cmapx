Distance: 1500m Conditions: 15&#45;18mph headwind and moderate chop. Some stronger gusts made conditions vary significantly between races. Floating starts were all close to the line, but varied slightly. Comments: In the boys&#39; 1st boat race, the race officials brought the crews to the line, switching lanes between Duxbury and Hanover to get the crews to the start quickly and stay clear of the rocks near the start. The coxswains adapted quickly and raced effectively in their reordered lanes.
In all, the crews handled the challenging conditions well. All of the coxswains and crews were efficient and effective at the start, allowing us to start races safely and fairly. While the conditions were slow, they were consistent across the lanes, making for fair racing.
Thank you to the Duxbury and Hanover athletes and coaches for making the trip to Concord and for bringing both competitive spirit and sportsmanship to the racing.
