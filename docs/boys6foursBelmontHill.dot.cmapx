Distance: 1300m Conditions: Variable wind, mostly tail/cross&#45;tail, fairly strong to start then diminishing throughout the racing (and even changing to a headwind for part of the 1V4 race). Great water throughout. Comments: Thanks to Nobles for a fantastic afternoon of racing. Belmont Hill retains the Bassett Cup by virtue of the win in the 1V4.
