Distance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Light wind changing throughout the day, starting as a tailwind, then a cross-wind and finishing the day as headwind.

Also in the B4, Stonington B3 raced in this event due to illness. A special thank you to St. John's an Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.
