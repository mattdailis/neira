Distance: 1400 Conditions: Flat water conditions, outgoing tide, cross tail wind 5&#45;7 mph. Comments: Time cannot be compared between races as the tide made starting at the line each time challenging, so while they were even bows, the line varied.
Race order was 3rd, 1st, 2nd then 4th. In the 4th boat race crews clashed and had to stop after the start, the race was restarted from that point. St. John&#39;s caught a boat stopping crab less than 300 meters from the finish, they recovered and completed the race.
Thanks to St. John&#39;s Prep for the long trip to Black Rock.

Distance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Light wind changing throughout the day, starting as a tailwind, then a cross&#45;wind and finishing the day as headwind. Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare times. In the B1 race Tabor caught a boat stopping crab at 300 meters down. In the B4, St. John&#39;s B had 2 boat stopping crabs. Also in the B4, Stonington B3 raced in this event due to illness. A special thank you to St. John&#39;s an Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.

In the B4 race, Andover and St. John&#39;s Prep combined rowers to make an entry.
