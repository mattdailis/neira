Distance: 1400m Conditions: Tailwind increasing in intensity as the races progressed. Rain throughout. Race Order GN4, G1V, B1V, BN8, G2V Comments: All floating starts. Races are not comparable. Novice races were about 150m shorter. In the Girls 2nd Varsity race, Guilford&#39;s steering wire snapped at 900m. They finished with no steering. East Lyme was ahead by open water when it snapped. Thank you East Lyme for a great day of racing
