Distance: 1400 Conditions: Flat water conditions, outgoing tide, cross tail wind 5-7 mph. Comments: Time cannot be compared between races as the tide made starting at the line each time challenging, so while they were even bows, the line varied.
Race order was 3rd, 1st, 2nd then 4th. In the 4th boat race crews clashed and had to stop after the start, the race was restarted from that point. St. John's caught a boat stopping crab less than 300 meters from the finish, they recovered and completed the race.
Thanks to St. John's Prep for the long trip to Black Rock.
