Distance: 1500 Conditions: ~9MPH crossing headwind from lane 6 to lane 1, with occasional gusts. Beginning of race slightly choppier than finish. Conditions seemed to improve marginally by last race (B1). Comments: Alternated races with girls races. Order of boys races: B5, B6, B4, B3, B2, B1.
St. Mark's 5 missed B5 race start time and raced in B6 race.
Gunn was a scratch in the B1 race.
Pomfret B3 caught two minor crabs early in its race.
Crossing wind pushed almost all boats at least one lane to port. Many referee calls for boats to move to starboard.
Congratulations to Taft B1 for winning the 2024 du Pont Cup.

04/20", weight="68", tooltip="NEIRA,Buckingham, Browne & Nichols vs Nobles, Groton			
Distance: 1350m Conditions: Excellent conditions.
Cloudy and cool
Mostly flat water.
A very light headwind for later races. Comments: In boys 4th boat race, Groton and BB&N clashed blades for roughly the first 20 strokes due to Groton moving into BB&N's lane off the start. This did not affect the order of finish but did have an effect on margins. Both boats handled the situation well once within it.
5th boats raced on the Powerhouse course approximately 2 hours earlier than Varsity racing.
NOTE: 6th, 7th boat races took place on the Charles River JV course, from Northeastern to the Kayak Pavilion.
BB&N and Nobles also raced their 7th and 8th boat crews in eights, a race which was slightly shorter due to a restart.
Times for this race were:
Nobles: 2:22.3
BB&N: 2:30.1
many thanks to all crews and coaches for a great day of racing for full teams.
