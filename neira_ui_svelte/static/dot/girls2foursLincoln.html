Distance: 1500m &amp; 2000m Conditions: Quartering headwind. Gusty at 1500m to go. Raced against incoming tide. Comments: 2nd Boat race distance was 1500m. 1st boat race distance was 2000m, but there was a restart 100m in due to a collision. Winsor's 3rd boat raced in the 2nd boat race with a time of 10:50.0. Thank you Winsor for coming to Providence and thank you NBC juniors for also racing us.
