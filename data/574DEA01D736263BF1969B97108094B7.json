    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Meters Conditions: Variable tail-crosswind from Lane 1 with strong gusts throughout the day. Comments: Races were floating starts, please do not compare times. The G3 started at approximately 1250 meter mark. In the B2 Shrewsbury crabbed at 750 meters down, an oar came out and the athletes was able to recover the oar. In the G3, Stonington raced a Novice 8, Tabor and East Lyme raced a mix of athletes. Only Latin and Simsbury should count toward seeding. A special thank you to St. John's and Shrewsbury for hosting the day. Simsbury wins the Simsbury/Tabor Pincombe Cup.\n\nNone",
