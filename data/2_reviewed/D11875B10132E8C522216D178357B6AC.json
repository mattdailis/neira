    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: 10 mph tail wind with gusts over 20 mph, decreasing throughout the day. Very strong tail current along course. Race order was 1V-N8. Minimal waves and chop.\r\nAll races were floating starts, times should not be compared. Comments: In girls 1V and boys 1V events, Glastonbury started the race about 1/2 seat above Stonington. In boys 1V, both crews were hit with a large wake 500m in due to a passing fishing boat. Both girls novice 8+ added a few extra meters by following the river's shore instead of the course. \r\nHuge thank you to Stonington for coming up after school and racing on the river.\r\n\nNone",
