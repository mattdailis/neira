    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Strong and gusting headwind and significant chop. Conditions improved some for the final races. All races were floating starts, some over the line. Race order was 5-4-3-2-1-6. Comments: Thank you to Hanover High School crews and coaches for racing effectively in difficult conditions.  There was a lot of good hard racing, despite the wind and the waves.\r\n\nNone",
