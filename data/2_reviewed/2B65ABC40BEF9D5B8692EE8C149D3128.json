    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 meters Conditions: Cold and rainy with otherwise good conditions. Light wind and flat water. All crews started 1-2 seats over the line. Comments: Many thanks to Deerfield and Exeter for making the trip and for excellent racing. St. Paul's retains the Davis Cup contested between SPS and Exeter, awarded to the winner of the majority of the girls' and boys' races (boats 1-4). With a 4-4 tie this year, SPS wins by virtue of the tie-breaker (in even years the winner of the girls' first eight).\n\nNone",
