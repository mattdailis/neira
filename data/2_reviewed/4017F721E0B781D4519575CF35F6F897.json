    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 m Conditions: Strong quartering tailwind increasing through races, dropping off in the 4s B Novice race. B4 race went from the finish line towards the starting line. Comments: Thank you to Watuppa Rowing Center for hosting their first race on their new 2000m buoyed race course and for Hotchkiss for making the long trip to Southeastern MA.\nOrder of races: B2 - G2 - B1 - G1 - B Novice 4+\nB2 - G1 - B1 began just past the starting line. G2 began 1 length over the starting line. B Novice 4+ started on the line.\nIn the G1 race, Hotchkiss caught a crab with 5 to 7 strokes to go. The race was very tight with only a seat separating the boats. All other races went off well.\n\nNone",
