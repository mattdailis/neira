    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: ~9MPH crossing headwind from lane 6 to lane 1, with occasional gusts. Beginning of race slightly choppier than finish. Conditions seemed to improve marginally by last race (B1). Comments: Alternated races with girls races. Order of boys races: B5, B6, B4, B3, B2, B1.\nSt. Mark's 5 missed B5 race start time and raced in B6 race.\nGunn was a scratch in the B1 race.\nPomfret B3 caught two minor crabs early in its race.\nCrossing wind pushed almost all boats at least one lane to port. Many referee calls for boats to move to starboard.\nCongratulations to Taft B1 for winning the 2024 du Pont Cup.\n\nNone",
