    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Strong cross wind with slight tail. Boats getting pushed hard to port side. Tide was in the direction of the course. 1v conditions were the worst of the day. Times are not comparable between events Comments: Salisbury 3v lost their skeg and thus had steering issues and didn\u2019t finish the race. \r\nThe fours raced by Stonington and Boston Latin were 3v rowers. \r\nThank you so much to Boston Latin and Salisbury for making the long trip to Mystic. Best of luck with the rest of the season.\r\n\nNone",
