    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: Strong crosswind at the start, becoming protected by the shore as race went on. Flat water conditions. Incoming tide but strong down stream current. Conditions consistent for all races. Comments: Boys \"4V\" was novices and boys \"5V\" was mixed novices. Girls \"3V\" and \"4\" were novice races. All novice races served as scrimmages to get athletes racing experience. Thank you to all teams for traveling Berwick!\r\n\nNone",
