    "comment": "\nDistance: 1201 Conditions: Slight Tail wind with some stronger gusts during racing.  Floating Starts Comments: In the Novice girls event.  It had varsity athletes in each shell in order to compete today.  In the Novice boys event Glastonbury rowed the race from 600 meter in with 7 rowers after an oar came out of the oar lock and athlete could not get it back in.  Thank you for Glastonbury coming to race on a school night and best of luck the rest of the season.\r\n\nNone",
