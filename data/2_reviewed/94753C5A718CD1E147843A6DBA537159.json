    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 meters Conditions: Sustained 14-15 mph headwind with gusts over 30 mph. Significant chop in the first 500 and last 150 for some of the races depending on timing of the gusts. Gusts were strongest during the G4 race. Comments: In the G4 race, Hanover caught two over-the-head crabs, but recovered well after both. In the G3 race, Hanover had an oar pop loose about 30\" into the race. The crew stopped briefly and then restarted after getting the oar back in the oarlock. Many thanks to Hanover for making the trip to Turkey Pond.\r\n\nNone",
