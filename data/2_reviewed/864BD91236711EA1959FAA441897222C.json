    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Warm and overcast with moderate and variable tailwind and good water.  With floating starts, the times are not precisely comparable. Comments: The 3rd eights started a bit over the line, while both the 1st and 2nd eights started on the line.  All crews handled the racing well.\r\n\r\nThank you to the Brunswick crews, coaches, and parents for traveling to Concord and for an excellent day of racing.\r\n\nNone",
