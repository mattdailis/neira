    "comment": "\nDistance: 1250m Conditions: Flat water, mild crosswind, good conditions. Comments: 1V race had to be stopped after 400m to avoid a collision as some college crews were rowing directly up the racecourse. Luckily, all boats avoided one another. We paddled back to the start and re-ran the race without incident. 2V race started slightly below the line. Thank you to Boston Latin for some spirited racing on the Charles!\r\n\nNone",
