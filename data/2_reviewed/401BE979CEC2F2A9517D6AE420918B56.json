    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 Conditions: Wicked fast current on the Merrimack River with a floating start so times between events should not be compared. Due to illness Duxbury was unable to race their boys 1v/2v. Thanks to Duxbury for making the trip. It was a great day of racing and every crew took it to the line (and in one case kept racing past the line!).\n\nNone",
