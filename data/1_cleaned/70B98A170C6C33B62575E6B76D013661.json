REVISED TIMES Correcting error in previously posted Boys 1st Boat Times.\r\n\r\nAll races were held in near ideal conditions with flat water and no wind. Intermittent light rain fell during most races and temperatures stayed in the 40's. \r\n\r\nThe one race of any incident was the G3V 8+. After a boat-stopping crab about 100 m after the start, Shrewsbury were left approximately 3-4 lengths in the wake of the Bedford girls. \r\n\r\nShrewsbury doggedly regathered & threw everything they had at chasing down Bedford - who by this stage held, what looked to be, insurmountable lead. Slowly but surely Shrewsbury regained contact and in a final burst, just 5 strokes before the finish line, edged their bow in front, by approximately 12 inches. \r\n\r\nThe finish was recorded by the finish tower officials and reviewed before awarding the race to Shrewsbury.\r\n\nNone",
