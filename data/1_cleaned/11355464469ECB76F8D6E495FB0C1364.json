    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500 meters Conditions: Strong crosswind throughout all races. In GV1 race, Dexter-Southfield \"A\" was GV1 and Dexter-Southfield \"B\" was GV2.   In BV2 race, Dexter-Southfield \"A\" was BV2 and Dexter-Southfield \"B\" was BV3.  The BV4 event was a Mixed Novice 4 scrimmage in order to get more kids racing. Thank you to Dexter-Southfield and Bancroft for racing today!\n\nNone",
