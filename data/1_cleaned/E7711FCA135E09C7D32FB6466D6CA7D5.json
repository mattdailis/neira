    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: It was warm and overcast with light to moderate tailwind and calm water.  The wind did pick up a bit in the middle of the schedule, but conditions were excellent throughout the racing. Comments: Rowing in good conditions, the crews showed good speed.  Winning six of the eight races that count towards the Richard F. Davis Team Trophy, Exeter takes home the Davis Trophy.\r\n\r\nThank you to the Exeter athletes and coaches for an excellent day of racing.\r\n\nNone",
