    "comment": "\nDistance: 1500m Conditions: Moderate cross-head wind, varying throughout the afternoon (least during the 1st-boat race) Comments: Order of racing 3, 2, 1, 4 to accommodate coxswain hot-seating. \r\n\r\nLovely as usual to welcome our friends from Brunswick to the lake for a great day of racing. Brunswick brings home the Curtis Trophy as a result of the first-boat race.\r\n\r\nLivestream recording here (I hope!) \r\nhttps://vimeo.com/1075061999\r\n\nNone",
