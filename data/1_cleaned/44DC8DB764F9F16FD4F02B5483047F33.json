    "comment": "\nDistance: 1650 Conditions: Variable conditions. 10-15 mph headwind against the current for B4, B5, G4, G5 races. Calm conditions, 5mph crosswind for B1, B2, B3, G1, G2, G3. Comments: In the girls' 5th boat race, times were not taken. The margin is recorded as the time from the winning crew.\r\n\r\nThank you to all crews for making the trip and staying flexible. As a result of thunderstorms, racing was delayed from 4:30pm to 7pm for the B1-3 and G1-3 crews. All crews managed the uncertainty and raced well.\r\n\r\nThank you to St. Paul's for supporting the addition of Kent to this race to make up our canceled race on April 12.\r\n\r\nThank you to Kent for making the extra effort to get these races in. In the racing between Kent and Andover, Andover wins the Perry and Brown Trophy (Boys' 1st boat) and the Hart Perry Cup (Girls' 1st boat).\r\n\nNone",
